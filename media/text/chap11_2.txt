NC: As I have no leader, I must fall back on the support of my family.
NC: It has been quite a while...
I can only hope they still accept me.

CA: OMG! Ninjy, you're really here!
This is the best best BEST day ever!!
NC: Hello, cousin...
Cranime.
CA: You're so silly, with that getup you always wear.
It covers up your beautiful smile!
You could look as pretty as me, you know.
NC: I'll... pass.
It is quite refreshing to have such levity in a conversation, though.
CA: Don't get too comfortable!
I heard some gossip at school. It's going to KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF!!
NC: Well, then. Out with it.
Let's bemuse and discuss the happenings of teenage crabs.
CA: I can't just TELL you, SILLY!
You'll have to BEAT IT out of me!
NC: ...Is that what high schoolers do now?

CA: You big meanie! You always take things so seriously...
NC: I fail to see an alternative to what I've done.
CA: Hmph! Now I don't WANT to tell you the gossip.
...
But I will anyways!
Some of the crabs at school have been getting offers to join a super exclusive group!
NC: No.
CA: Something about, stars?
NC: NO.
CA: Oh yeah, they were Star Seekers! Pretty nerdy, but the dreamy hunks are all joining it.
Maybe they'll invite me too!
NC: ...I took a break from this accursed group.
But now it's seeping into my most sacred of spaces... my family.
No longer a silent force, it's time to take matters to the source.

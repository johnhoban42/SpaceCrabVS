RC: Still, it's a little weird that only two fans showed up.
The groupies didn't even bother to come?
...Not even Rave Crab? My fa-
??: Aaaahhh! Sorry I'm late!
TC: Really, TRULY, super sorry, sir.
RL: It's about time, Toppy! Where were you?
TC: Well, I was practicing my spinning for the Star Seekers, and I guess I lost track of time...
That's why I got here 58 minutes early instead of the full hour! Again, so sorry!
RL: You think you're EARLY? I've been playing without a stage this whole time!
Let's set things up before anyone else sees this embarrassment of a setup.
And our setup song? Shooting Stars into Dreams, REMix!
Let's go!

RL: Through all that chaos, we got the stage ready.
Nicely done! You must be working on your debilitating clumsiness.
TC: Haha, thank you... that means a lot, coming from you.
Since joining the Star Seekers, I've really been working to improve.
And thanks to that effort, we got the stage set up, just in time for the concert to start!
RL: Just in time? That's something I've been wanting to ask about...

RL: BBFDd; Still, it's a little weird that only two fans showed up.
BAFEa; The groupies didn't even bother to come?
BMFEd; ...Not even Rave Crab? My little funny buddy?
??: Aaaahhh! Sorry I'm late!
TC: BBFHj; Really, TRULY, super sorry, sir.
RL: BAFBa; It's about time, Toppy! Where were you?
TC: BDFHm; Well, I was practicing my spinning for the Star Seekers, and I guess I lost track of time...
BVFMd; That's why I got here 58 minutes early instead of the full hour! Again, so sorry!
RL: BMFBa; You think you're EARLY? I've been playing without a stage this whole time!
BAFD; Let's set things up before anyone else sees this embarrassment of a setup.
BIFDb; And our setup song? Shooting Stars into Dreams, REMix!
BMFDb; Let's go!

RL: BBFRb; Through all that chaos, we got the stage ready.
BAFAd; Nicely done! Seems like you're getting a better handle on your clumsiness.
TC: BDFIa; Haha, thank you... that means a lot, coming from you.
BMFJb; Since joining the Star Seekers, I've really been working to improve.
BKFO; And thanks to that effort, we got the stage set up, just in time for the concert to start!
RL: BMFF; Just in time, huh? That's something that's been bothering me...

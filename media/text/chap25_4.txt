FC: BF; Being in the past is quite tiring.
BF; I've done more talking in the last day than I've done in the past 30 years!
BF; Still, there's one more crab I need to talk to.
BF; Space Crab.
SC: BF; Space Crab.
BF; You know, we have to do it, one more time. Finish things off right.
FC: BF; A battle? Is that what you're getting at? Well, in that case, why not get things started?
SC: BF; Hold on. I have to warn you- I'm going all out for this one.
FC: BF; Oh, please. I'm you. I can take it.
BF; Being here in the past, seeing so many familiar faces-
BF; I feel as fit to fight as I did in the old days! Bring it!

FC: BF; Well, past me - it looks like you have some training to do.
SC: BF; No biggie, I've got time. Speaking of...
BF; How much time do YOU have left?
FC: BF; Don't worry about me. I'm sticking around - my future wasn't much fun anyways.
BF; I'm eager to see how your future turns out.
BF; And YOUR future, too. Yeah, YOU, the one reading our words.
BF; Go outside and fight anyone you meet! That's the moral we're imparting.
SC: BF; NO! No it isn't. Though, I do want to thank you for playing until the very end!
BF; I wasn't sure how many of you would make it this far. So happy to see you here!
BF; And I know the developers are happy, too. They all put tons of love into making the game.
BF; See you in the next Space Crab! Whenever that is.
BF; Until then, we'll all be here. Seeking stars, and ready to battle!

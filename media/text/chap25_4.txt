FC: BBFAb; Being in the past is quite tiring.

BWFJe; Still, there's one more crab I need to talk to.
BVFAe; Space Crab.
SC: BVFAe; Space Crab.
BMFQa; You know, we have to do it, one more time. Finish things off right.
FC: BPFB; A battle? Is that what you're getting at? Well, in that case, why not get things started?
SC: BSFEb; Hold on. I have to warn you- I'm going all out for this one.
FC: BMFDb; Oh, please. I'm you. I can take it.
BWFGa; Being here in the past, seeing so many familiar faces-
BPFB; I feel as fit to fight as I did in the old days! Bring it!

FC: BAFAe; Well, past me - it looks like you have some training to do.
SC: BDFI; No biggie, I've got time. Speaking of...
BWFJe; How much time do YOU have left?
FC: BMFAa; Don't worry about me. I'm sticking around - my future wasn't much fun anyways.
BVFA; I'm eager to see how your future turns out.
BAFJf; And YOUR future, too. Yeah, YOU, the one reading our words.
BPFDb; Go outside and fight anyone you meet! That's the moral we're imparting.
SC: BSFKc; NO! No it isn't.
BMFJf; Though, I do want to thank you for playing until the very end!
BKFO; I wasn't sure how many of you would make it this far. So happy to see you here!
BAFTu; And I know the developers are happy, too. They all put tons of love into making the game.
BKFJf; See you in the next Space Crab! Whenever that is.
BVFOd; Until then, we'll all be here. Seeking stars, and ready to battle!

FC: Being in the past is quite tiring.
I've done more talking in the past day than I've done in the past 30 years!
Still, there's one more crab I need to talk to.
Space Crab.
SC: Space Crab.
You know, we have to do it, one more time. Finish things off right.
FC: A battle? Is that what you're getting at?
Well, in that case, why not get things started?
SC: Hold on. I have to warn you- I'm going all out for this one.
FC: Oh, please. I'm you. I can take it.
Being here in the past, seeing so many familiar faces-
I feel as fit to fight as I did in the old days! Bring it!

FC: Well, past me - it looks like you have some training to do.
SC: No biggie, I've got time. Speaking of...
How much time do YOU have left?
FC: Don't worry about me. I'm sticking around - my future wasn't much fun anyways.
I'm eager to see how your future turns out.
And YOUR future, too. Yeah, YOU, the one reading our words.
Go outside and fight anyone you meet! That's the moral we're imparting.
SC: NO! No it isn't. Though, I do want to thank you for playing until the very end!
I wasn't sure how many of you would make it this far. So happy to see you here!
And I know the developers are happy, too. They all put tons of love into making the game.
See you in the next Space Crab! Whenever that is.
Until then, we'll all be here. Seeking stars, and ready to battle!

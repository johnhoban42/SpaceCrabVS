1F: BOFSb; Taxi Crab! Taxi Crab! I need you to take me to Space Crab, STAT!
TX: BBFUa; Hold your horses. We've talked about this before, right?
BBFDa; I can take you to places, but not crabs.
BKFJd; Remember your King Crab phase?
BDFDd; He said he'd lock you up if he ever saw you creeping on him again.
1F: BSFTs; This is different! Apparently, Space Crab WANTS crabs to come to him.
BUFOf; He's making a Star Seekers group!
BWFA; And I'm not giving up my chance to join!
TX: BBFGa; Tell ya what... my drives have been long and dull for a while, yeah?
BBFJa; Could use some excitement.
BKFJc; Let's have a quick tussle, get some blood pumping, then I'll give you a lift.
1F: BVFOd; Yes!

1F: Taxi Crab! Taxi Crab! I need you to take me to Space Crab, STAT!
TX: Hold your horses. We've talked about this before, right?
I can take you to places, but not crabs.
Remember your King Crab phase?
He said he'd lock you up if he ever saw you creeping on him again.
1F: This is different! Apparently, Space Crab WANTS crabs to come to him.
He's making a Star Seekers group!
And I'm not giving up my chance for joining!
TX: Tell ya what... my drives have been long and dull for a while, yeah?
Could use some exitement.
Let's have a quick tussle, get some blood pumping, and I'll give you a lift.
1F: Oh yeah!

I also printed out flyers for the Star Seekers!
Can I hang them all over the backseat?

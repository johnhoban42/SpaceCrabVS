LW: BIFDb; Space Crab! Space Crab! I'm glad I found you!
SC: BAFA; Oh, Ladder Wizard! I actually wanted to ask you something...
LW: Later, later! Boy, oh boy, you've GOT to hear this!
SC: BBFEb; Uh, sure, go ahead.
LW: BAFAc; Well, I thought, the hills in the Crab Nebula, right?
BAFDa; Meteors sneak up behind them, and always catch us!
BAFBd; And the Crustacean Station, the satellites - WAY too unpredictable!
SC: BAFF; Okay... go on...
LW: BAFD; So I thought, I'll need to enhance my dodges, yes?
BAFDc; A few spells later, bing, bang, boom...
BKFPb; Now, I can fly through the air, by DOUBLE TURNING! Haha, yes! It's true!
SC: BAFU; (Eh, it's not THAT impressive...)
BAFHa; (I mean, ALL of us can DOUBLE TURN to dodge, or jump, or something else...)
BAFU; That's great and all, but I wanted to ask-
LW: BKFL; It's a marvel of modern wizardry! Heights my grandfather could only DREAM of reaching!
SC: (Geez... when he's like this, there's no getting through to him.)
BAFD; (I need to snap him out of it!)
SC: BAFDb; Why not show me your skills, then? How about a quick one-on-one battle?
LW: BKFB; Yes, an excellent idea for an excellent occasion!
BCFB1; I hope you're ready to marvel at this magical display!

LW: BAFAd; Wow, you've become quite powerful since I last saw you!
BAFD1c; I'll need to continue my wizardry studies to keep up.
BAFJb; What was it you wanted to bring up, earlier?
SC: BAFAe; I'm glad you asked! I'm putting together a group- to explore the cosmos, to solve it's mysteries-
BKFAh; The Star Seekers!
BAFB; Can I count you in?
LW: BAFT1; Sounds like an excellent time!
BIFAd; I can lend my knowledge of space and it's magical properties - anything you want to know.
SC: BAFAd; That's great to hear!!
BAFDb; If you can think of anyone else, ask them to join too! Thanks a ton, gotta run!

LW: Space Crab! Space Crab! I'm glad I found you!
SC: Oh, Ladder Wizard! I actually wanted to ask you something...
LW: Later, later! Oh boy, oh boy, you've GOT to hear this!
SC: Uh, sure, go ahead.
LW: Well, I thought, the hills in the Crab Nebula, right?
Meteors sneak up behind them, and always catch us!
And the Crustacean Station, the satellites - WAY too unpredictable!
SC: Okay... go on...
LW: So I thought, I'll need to enhance my dodges, yes?
A few spells later, bing, bang, boom...
Now, I can fly through the air, by DOUBLE TURNING! Haha, yes! It's true!
SC: (Eh, it's not THAT impressive...)
(I mean, all of us can DOUBLE TURN to dodge, or jump, or something else...)
That's great and all, but I wanted to ask-
LW: It's a marvel of modern wizardry! Heights my grandfather could only DREAM of reaching!
(Geez... when he's like this, there's no getting through to him.)
(I need to snap him out of it!)
SC: Why not show me your skills, then? How about a quick one-on-one battle?
LW: Yes, an excellent idea for an excellent occasion!
I hope you're ready to marvel at this magical display!

LW: Wow, you've become quite powerful since I last saw you!
I'll need to continue my wizardry studies to keep up.
What was it you wanted to bring up, earlier?
SC: I'm glad you asked! I'm putting together a group- to explore the cosmos, to solve it's mysteries-
The Star Seekers!
Can I count you in?
LW: Sounds like an excellent time!
I can contribute my knowledge of space and it's magical properties - anything you want to know.
SC: That's great to hear!!
If you can think of anyone else, ask them to join too! Thanks a ton, gotta run!

CA: Chrono Crab! I'm glad you agreed to meet with me on such short notice.
CC: No notice is too short when I control time itself!
CA: That's actually the precise reason I came to see you.

A feast for the Star Seekers? Preposterous. How can you support such villany?

I am a professional.
I fulfill orders for my paying customers, no matter who they are.
Now help me speed up these ovens, or so help me...

I will rip your arms off, and use your time powers myself.
CC: You'll... what?!

CA: In the end, he decided to help me, all on his own.
And THAT is how I got your cakes baked so fast!
SC: Oh. Uhhh, haha, great.

CA: Oh! By the way...
SC: Yeah?
CA: When you give this order to Space Crab, tell him I'm a huge fan!
SC: ...Sure. Will do.

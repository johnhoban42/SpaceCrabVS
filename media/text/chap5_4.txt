KC: BAFD; I'm already tired of waiting.
BIFBa; Let me just skip to the exciting part!

SC: BOFDe; Chrono Crab! Show yourself!
KC: BBFDb; Well, well, it's the crab of the hour.
BIFDc; Did that laut, Inianda Jeff, drag you in?
SC: BSFJd; What? No!
BPFDa; I got a call that Chrono Crab is waiting here to challenge me!
BPFHa; Where is he?! Was it a prank call, or what?
KC: BMFD; Frankly, I have negative cares about your little prattle.
BWFDa; What I do care about, though...
BPFB; Is the permanent disbanding of the Star Seekers!
SC: BSFDe; No. You have no power to do that!

KC: BMFDb; What you are not understanding, is my powerful shrimp army, and my spacious dungeon.
BUaFAe; So yes, I do have power to do that. That, and much, much worse.

SC: BTFNf; (Uh oh.)
BTFNd; (C'mon, think, think...)
BWFMd; (I just need to buy some time to... think of SOMETHING!)
BPFDe; Battle me! If you win, then you can do whatever you want to me!
BVFBd; Lock me up, take all my stuff, disband the Star Seekers, anything you want!
KC: BAFOb; Those are some great ideas! I appreciate your cooperation.

KC: BAFAf; Any last words before you're thrown behind metal bars?
SC: BQFYc; (This is my one shot!)
BBFD; Well, if you must...
BCFJa; It's just a shame that the Star Seekers will never have a KING of their own.
music
KC: BAFC; Hmm?
SC: BUaFJe; They have a leader, sure, but no figurehead! No head honcho!
CC: BIFKc; (This trick offers no substance! His bait, too obvious!)
SC: BMFH; And if I go to jail, I'm sure they'll never be able to find a king by themselves.
KC: BOFBe; You think you can sway me? I've already decided.
KC: BMFD; ...
KC: BOFKg; I will JOIN the Star Seekers.

CC: BBFJ; What.
NC: BBFMd; ...
KC: BNFDb; They need a King, no? And not just a wimpy leader like that there, Space Crab.
BAFO; Why have only a leader, when you can also have a KING?
BMFAa; KING of the Star Seekers... a title befitting of me, yes?
BKFOa; Oohohoho!
NC: BBFEd; I... did not anticipate this. I stand down.
CC: BBFD; Hmph.
SC: BLFQ; Excited to have you on board, King Crab!
KC: BMFB; On board? I am the board! The figurehead!
BUFOb; Yes, I could get used to this.

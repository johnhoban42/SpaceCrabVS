KC: I'm already tired of waiting.
Let me just skip to the exciting part!
CC: No worries, Crabbed King. Your wish has been advanced in time.

SC: Chrono Crab! Show yourself!
KC: Well well, the crab of the hour.
Did that laut, Inianda Jeff, drag you in?
SC: What? No!
I got a call that Chrono Crab is waiting here to challenge me!
Where is he?! Was it a prank call, or what?
KC: Frankly, I have negative cares about your little prattle.
What I do care about, though...
Is the permanent disbanding of the Star Seekers!

SC: No. You have no power to do that!
KC: What you are missing, is my powerful shrimp army, and my spacious dungeon.
So yes, I do have power to do that.
SC: (Uh oh.)
(C'mon, think, think...)
(I just need to buy some time to... think of SOMETHING!)
Battle me! If you win, then you can do whatever you want to me!
Lock me up, take all my stuff, disband the Star Seekers, anything!
KC: Those are some great ideas! I appreciate your cooperation.

KC: Any last words before you're thrown behind metal bars?
SC: (This is my one shot!)
Well, if you must...
But it's a shame that the Star Seekers will never have a KING of their own!
KC: Hmm?
SC: They have a leader, sure, but no figurehead! No head honcho!
And if I go to jail, I'm sure they'll never be able to find a king by themselves.
KC: You think you can sway me? I've already decided.
KC: ...
KC: I will JOIN the Star Seekers.
CC: What.
NC: ...
KC: They need a King, no? And not just a wimpy leader like this here, Space Crab.
Why have a just a leader when you can also have a KING?
KING of the Star Seekers... a title befitting of me, yes?
Ohhohoho!
NC: I... did not anticipate this. I step down.

CC: Hmph.

SC: Excited to have you on board, King Crab!
KC: On board? I am the board! The figurehead!
Yes, I could get used to this.

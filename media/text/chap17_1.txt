BF; I feel a great sense of distress out in the cosmos.

BF; And, a lot of crabs injured in battle?
BF; Odd, how often that's happened recently.
BF; Among the distress, one prayer stands out-
BF; 'Please, help everyone get along!'
BF; Whoever sent this call for help, know that I have heard your plea.
BF; Though, to do unto others, I must first prove myself a worthy vessel.

HL: BF; Yes, I can feel the power of Holy divination flowing through me!
BF; And I know that those crabs in need have the power inside them, too.
BF; They just need a little push.
BF; Do YOU think we'll be able to help these crabs?
BF; That's right. I'm talking to YOU.
TX: BF; Oh! Me? Sorry, I wasn't listening to your little spiel back there.
BF; We've still got a bit of a drive until your first stop.
BF; So just kick your feet up and relax back there, yeah?
HL: BF; Splendid news. I'll do just that.

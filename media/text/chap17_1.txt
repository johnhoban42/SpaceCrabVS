HL: Oh my.
I feel a great sense of distress out in the cosmos.
Crabs in pain, crabs confused-
And, a lot of crabs injured in battle?
Odd, how often that's happened recently.
Among the distress, one prayer stands out-
'Please, help everyone get along!'
Whoever sent this call for help, know that I have heard your plea.
Though, to do unto others, I must first prove myself a worthy vessel.
If I can dodge 50 meteors, then may I yet be able to heal those in need.
Let us begin the self evaluation.

HL: Yes, I can feel the power of Holy divination flowing through me!
And I know that those crabs in need have the power inside them, too.
They just need a little push.
Do YOU think we'll be able to help these crabs?
That's right. I'm talking to YOU.
TX: Oh! Me? Sorry, I wasn't listening to your little spiel back there.
We've still got a bit of a drive until your first stop.
So just kick your feet up and relax back there, yeah?
HL: Splendid news. I'll do just that.

S8: I've... run out of options...
It's... all over for me.
RC: Hey man! Why so much moping? I can feel your vibes from a mile away!
S8: Who, me? No, I'm doing great.
Having your song rejected by the biggest names in music across the galaxy...
Its fiiiine.
RC: Hey, no need to hide your feelings. Let's talk it out.
You said it's about a song? Wait, do you write music?! That's awesome!
S8: Yeah, I do, but it's nothing big. Just a little something I came up with.
I call it 'Sk8r Zo'-
music
No... I call it 'TAKE ME OUT'!

S8: And that's the song, 'TAKE ME OUT'! Hope you enjoyed it.
RC: Dude, that got me ALL KINDS of pumped up!
You don't need a label - you have an anthem!
Don't worry about getting approval from the bigwigs- you've got a fan in me.
Spread your song, your message- I'm sure others will follow!
S8: W-wow, that's a lot of enthusiasm...
I appreciate it! Thanks for the encouragement.

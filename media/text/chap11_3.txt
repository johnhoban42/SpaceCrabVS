NC: Ladder Wizard the Third. I've come to talk.
LW: Hmm?
Aughh! It's you again!
music sadsong
NC: You're disgusting. Not only for restarting the Star Seekers...
But for spreading it's vile ways to the youth of today!
My poor cousin has been infected by the poison of your ideologies.

LW: Slow down, slow down! You lost me at the beginning.
Did you say, 'restart'?

NC: Oh, please. You of all crabs should know your family history.
LW: I, uh, don't though.
NC: Don't play dumb!
It was YOUR grandfather, Ladder Wizard the First, who joined the original Star Seekers.
But he wasn't sastisfied with that, was he?
A menace to all, he tore down the other crabs, just to climb the corporate ladder.
Thanks to his underhanded tricks, he earned the uncouth name, 'Ladder Wizard'.
LW: Wow, THAT's where my name comes from?
Makes more sense then actual ladders, I suppose.
NC: Ladder Wizard the First's behaviour spread to the others.
A true 'crabs in a bucket' situation, the once Star Seekers collapsed quickly.
But it did not end there.
That destructive, nasty behaviour spread to nearly every crab.
Except one - my grandfather, Ninja Crab the 81st.
LW: EIGHTY FIRST?! How many Ninja Crabs have there been?!
NC: His willpower and watchful eye slowly healed the galaxy.

NC: Until YOU showed up, wanting to re-open the wounds your grandfather caused. 
So fight me, so we can end this generational fued!
LW: Wait! Stop! I'm not a part of this! I don't know anything about this stuff!

NC: Your words, they are true.
You fight nothing like your grandfather.
LW: Yeah, I told you that already.
The Star Seekers were Space Crab's idea. I never even met my grandpa!
NC: So the forming and naming of both groups... is coincidental?
LW: Yeah, ha ha! I guess so.
NC: I'm still unconvinced.

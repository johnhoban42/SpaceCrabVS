NC: BVFB; Ladder Wizard the Third. I've come to talk.
LW: BAFKi; Hmm?
BHFP; Aughh! It's you again!
music emotion
NC: BOFB; You're despicable. Not only for restarting the Star Seekers...
BVFB; But for spreading it's vile ways to the youth of today!
BMFH; My poor cousin has been infected by the poison of your ideologies.

LW: BDFE1a; Slow down, slow down! You lost me at the beginning.
BNFFd; Did you say, 'restart'?
music emotion
NC: BUFB; Oh, please. You of all crabs should know your family history.
LW: BBFU1; I, uh, don't though.
NC: BOFB; Don't play dumb!
BPFD; It was YOUR grandfather, Ladder Wizard the First, who started the original Star Seekers.
BAFB; But he wasn't satisfied with that, was he?
BOFD; A menace to all, he tore down all other expedition groups, just to climb the social ladder.
BIFRa; Thanks to his underhanded tricks, he earned the uncouth name, 'Ladder Wizard'.
LW: BAFJ1a; Wow, THAT's where my name comes from?
BBFIa; Makes more sense then actual ladders, I suppose.
NC: BPFD; Ladder Wizard the First's behavior spread to the others.
BAFD; A true 'crabs in a bucket' situation, the once 'Star Seekers' collapsed quickly.
BBFRa; But it did not end there.
BAFD; That destructive, nasty behavior spread to nearly every crab.
BMFA; Except one - my grandfather, Ninja Crab the 81st.
LW: BHFP; EIGHTY FIRST?! How many Ninja Crabs have there been?!
NC: BMFTp; His willpower and watchful eye slowly healed the galaxy.
music fightB
NC: BPFB; Until YOU showed up, wanting to re-open the wounds your grandfather caused. 
BVFB; So fight me, so we can end this generational feud!
LW: BHFPa; Wait! Stop! I'm not a part of this! I don't know anything about this stuff!

NC: BBFH; Your words, they are true.
BAFE; Your fighting style is nothing like your grandfather's underhanded tactics.
LW: BSFMd; Yeah, I told you that already.
BUFF; The Star Seekers were Space Crab's idea. I never even met my grandpa!
NC: BAFF; So the forming and naming of both groups... is coincidental?
LW: BBFAf; Yeah, ha ha! I guess so.
NC: BBFG; I'm still unconvinced.

BAFD; Though I feel that I will find my answer soon...

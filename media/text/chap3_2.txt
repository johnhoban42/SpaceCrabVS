1F: BKFOb; Top Crab! You won't believe the big news! The latest scoop!
TC: BEFEc; Is this about your hero guy? I think you're getting a bit obsessed...
1F: BDFEb; He's not my 'hero', I just... like reading about him.
BMFBd; Plus, I'm a completionist! If I don't know all of the news, then what am I doing this for?
TC: BEFEa; You could just spend your time doing something else.
BBFBa; As for me, I got asked to join a cool new group - so I'm putting all of my time into my spinning practice.
BBFA; If I'm going to be a part of it, then I need to be useful!
BBFBc; Or consistant, at least.
1F: BNFHa; A group, a group...
BKFS; THAT'S IT! Maybe we heard about the same group!
BOFSb; Buddy, do you remember who asked you to join?
TC: BAFB; Now that you mention it, I don't think I asked his name.
BAFBa; What kind of crab was he? Spade Crab? Shade Crab?
BAFA; Maybe I'll remember the name if we recreate the situation.
1F: BSFSa; Of course! I NEED the info you have.
BMFS; What were you doing before he asked you to join?
TC: BDFD; Battling!

1F: BAFO; I KNEW IT!!
BSFS; He asked YOU to join the Star Seekers?? That's incredible!
BVFOc; Maybe there's hope for me to join, too!
TC: BEFEc; Uhh, yeah, I think so - he seemed pretty open to let anyone join.
BEFEc; I think you're making a bigger deal out of this than-

BEFEc; Ah- nevermind, then.
BCFBa; I need to get back to my spin training, anyways.

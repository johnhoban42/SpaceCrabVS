CC: BKFTo; What a refreshing ride! That Taxi Crab sure knows how to chauffeur a posse.
1F: BBFUa; Maybe it was nice in the front seat...
BCFRb; Team Player, did you really have to wear your helmet the whole time? It made things kind of tight.
TP: BVFBa; I could say the same to you, Mr. Foam Fingers in my face!
IJ: BSFOc; Aaaand here! This should be the spot.
CC: BAFOg; Splendid work, Jeffery. Truly, the boast of the business.
1F: BWFHa; Uh, sir? There's nothing here. Just empty space...
TP: BBFEe; Yeah, coach. It's not even like, interesting space. There's nothing!
CC: BUFOe; Precisely. Did you really believe that the mirror dimension was a 24/7 buffet?
BDFKh; It's more akin to a one-hour buffet... open every three weeks!
BJFXe; Not to worry - we will simply outwait the timer, and the dimension will be ours for the taking!
BJFXa; Yes, WAITING is the only solution to this issue.

BSFTp; Time doesn't just grow on trees, illiterates.
BWFOj; I need to charge my powers up in battle, just like all of you.
TP: BIFBa; ARGH! First we have that boring taxi ride, and now we have to sit around here for weeks...
BVFMd; Coach, I can't keep waiting around! I need a training plan, stat!
CC: BAFTp; Message received. You - the Player. Here's your warmup routine - battle me and charge us up!
TP: BPFDe; You got it coach! I won't hold back!

CC: BZFQ; Enough power to activate... FAST FORWARD!
IJ: BVFSb; By the jones, I see it! A little tear, getting bigger and bigger!

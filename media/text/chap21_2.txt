CC: What a refreshing ride! That Taxi Crab sure knows how to chauffeur a posse.
1F: Maybe it was nice in the front seat...
Team Player, did you really have to wear your helmet the whole time? It made things kind of tight.
TP: I could say the same to you, Mr. Foam Fingers in my face!

CC: Splendid work, Jeffery. Truly, the boast of the business.
1F: Uh, sir? There's nothing here. Just empty space...
TP: Yeah, coach. It's not even like, interesting space. There's nothing!
CC: Precisely. Did you really believe that the mirror dimension was a 24/7 buffet?
It's more akin to a one-hour buffet... open every three weeks!

Yes, WAITING is the only solution to this issue.

Coach, I can't keep waiting around! I need a training plan, stat!
CC: Message received. You - the player. Here's your warmup routine - battle me and charge us up!
TP: You got it coach! I won't hold back!

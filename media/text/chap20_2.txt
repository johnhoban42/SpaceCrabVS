Yes. I can sense it, alright.
There exists a profound evil, whose plan is nearing its climax.
Do you really think it's prudent to take a vacation?
HW: Augh! Geez. Don't go sneaking up on people holding up a big sword.
Why do you care if I take a vacation? I've earned this.
I had to deal with all that crazy Star Seekers stuff - I need a chance to relax.
KN: You think you've earned the right to relax? You kids and your 'vacation time'.
HW: Hey old-timer, they made workers rights for a reason! I'm using what's rightfully mine!
KN: A job not done is nary a job done at all.
HW: You crazy old man, you're not making any sense.
KN: Oh, call me crazy, will you?
If you can't stand up to my barrage, then what hope do you have to face the evil?
HW: Your barrage? The evil? Huh?

KN: Young man, you seem to be very tense. Your lack of skill & talent makes that obvious.
HW: That hurts. This whole thing hurts. (knocked out)
KN: Have you considered a career change? You may find a greater purpose in life.
It happens to the best of us- our spirits are unaligned with our current goals.
In fact, my mentor used to be a Ninja, before he hung up the throwing star and picked up the sword.
Maybe YOU need a mentor? Someone manly, strong, and currently standing next to you?
We will begin your training soon. But for now...
EVIL AWAITS! No time to waste!

HW: So he beats me up for using my vacation time, and then he becomes my career advisor??
HW: Who cares about that evil plot, or whatever...
With maniacs like HIM running around, I better join those Star Seekers again, for my own safety!

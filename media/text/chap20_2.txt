KN: B0IFA; Yes. I can sense it, alright.
B0OFC; There exists a profound evil, whose plan is nearing its climax.
BZFD; Do you really find it prudent to take a vacation?
HC: BHFPa; Augh! Geez. Don't go sneaking up on people holding up a big sword.
BMFDd; Why do you care if I take a vacation? I've earned this.
BBFOj; I had to deal with all that crazy Star Seekers stuff - I need a chance to relax.
KN: BUFD; You think you've earned the right to relax? You kids and your 'vacation time'.
HC: BVFBa; Hey old-timer, they made workers rights for a reason! I'm using what's rightfully mine!
KN: BMFOa; A job not done is nary a job done at all.
HC: BUFWa; You crazy old man, you're not making any sense.
KN: BVFB; Oh, call me crazy, will you?
BZFB; If you can't stand up to my barrage, then what hope do you have to face the evil?
HC: BBFDd; Your barrage? The evil? Huh?

KN: B0BFA; Young man, you seem to be very tense. Your lack of skill & talent makes that obvious.
HC: BJFXb; That hurts. This whole thing hurts.
KN: B0AFA; Have you considered a career change? You may find a greater purpose in life.
B0MFC; It happens to the best of us- our spirits are unaligned with our current goals.
B0AFG; In fact, my mentor used to be a Ninja, before he hung up the throwing star and picked up the sword.
B0MFOf; Maybe YOU need a mentor? Someone manly, strong, and currently standing next to you?
B0OFC; We will begin your training soon. But for now...
BZFD; EVIL AWAITS! No time to waste!

HC: BBFEd; So he beats me up for using my vacation time, and then he becomes my career advisor??
HC: BWFH; Who cares about that evil plot, or whatever...
BSFKc; With maniacs like HIM running around, I better join those Star Seekers again, for my own safety!

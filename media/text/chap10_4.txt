RL: It's just all a bit strange.
TC: Hmm? What's that, sir?
RL: First, nobody shows up. Then, Maddy came by, saying that I shouldn't be playing.
And then, you claim to be EARLY, even though the concert's been going on for hours!
TC: Hours? HOURS? That can't be!
I triple checked my clock, watch, AND sundial before coming!
RC: Well, let me see your wrist, I'll check it a fourth time.
Oh.
Odd, you're three hours behind me!
TC: Hmmm... I might have a hunch why...
Have you heard of a guy named Chrono Crab?
RC: Chrono Crab? You mean my roommate?
TC: ...That explains it.
??: YO, Rock Lobster, are you gonna play or what?
RL: !
Is that...?
RC: We all came out to hear a rockin' show, time for you to deliver!
TP: Show 'em how it's done, Rock Lobster!
HC: You're my favorite part of any vacation!
LW: Rock-Lob-ster! Rock-Lob-star!
RC: Give the crabs what they want!
RL: Aww... you all...
OK!
I'll give you a show you won't forget!
My newest single, straight from the cosmic stardust...
Starlight Rivals!
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR!

RC: That was incredible playing, Rock Lobster!
Best party I've been to all year!!
RL: Oh, you know it. Would you expect anything less from THE Rock Lobster?
RC: OH! I've got a radical idea!
Ever heard of the Star Seekers?
RL: Y'know, yeah, I have. I heard a groupie mention it earlier.
RC: Why not join? You can make it so the party never stops, wherever we go!
Constantly surrounded by your adoring fans- what do you say?
RL: For the fans? How can I say no!?
Count me in, party-man.

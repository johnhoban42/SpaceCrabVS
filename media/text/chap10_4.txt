RL: BNFF; It's all just a bit strange.
TC: BBFJd; Hmm? Why's that?
RL: BUFGd; First, nobody shows up. Then, Maddy came by, saying that I shouldn't be playing.
BSFDd; And then, YOU claim to be EARLY, even though the concert's been going on for hours!
TC: BHFPa; Hours? HOURS? That can't be!
BAFHj; I triple checked my clock, watch, AND sundial before coming!
RL: BAFBa; Well, let me see your wrist, I'll check it a fourth time.
BBFJ; Oh.
BAFDd; Weird, you're three hours behind me!
TC: BBFHa; Well... I might have a hunch why...
BAFJd; Have you heard of a guy named Chrono Crab? He makes time... weird.
RL: BMFFd; Chrono Crab? You mean my roommate?
TC: BBFIa; ...That explains it.

RC: BKFO; That was incredible playing, Rock Lobster! Best party I've been to all year!!
RL: BMFKg; Oh, you know it. Would you expect anything less from THE Rock Lobster?
RC: BBFS; OH! I've got a radical idea!
BAFSa; Ever heard of the Star Seekers?
RL: BUFGb; Y'know, yeah, I have. I heard a groupie mention it earlier.
RC: BOFAg; Why not join? You can make it so the party never stops, wherever we go!
BCFOc; Constantly surrounded by your adoring fans- what do you say?
RL: BMFKg; For the fans? How can I say no!?
BAFQa; Count me in, party-man.

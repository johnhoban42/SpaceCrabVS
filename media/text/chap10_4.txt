RL: BF; It's just all a bit strange.
TC: BF; Hmm? What's that, sir?
RL: BF; First, nobody shows up. Then, Maddy came by, saying that I shouldn't be playing.
BF; And then, you claim to be EARLY, even though the concert's been going on for hours!
TC: BBFKh; Hours? HOURS? That can't be!
BAFHj; I triple checked my clock, watch, AND sundial before coming!
RC: BF; Well, let me see your wrist, I'll check it a fourth time.
BF; Oh.
BF; Odd, you're three hours behind me!
TC: BF; Hmmm... I might have a hunch why...
BF; Have you heard of a guy named Chrono Crab?
RL: BF; Chrono Crab? You mean my roommate?
TC: BBFIa; ...That explains it.
??: YO, Rock Lobster, are you gonna play or what?
RL: BF; !
BF; Is that...?
RC: BF; We all came out to hear a rockin' show, time for you to deliver!
TP: BF; Show 'em how it's done, Rock Lobster!
HC: BF; You're my favorite part of any vacation!
LW: BF; Rock-Lob-ster! Rock-Lob-star!
RC: BF; Give the crabs what they want!
RL: BF; Aww... you all...
BF; OK!
BF; I'll give you a show you won't forget!
BF; My newest single, straight from the cosmic stardust...
BF; Starlight Rivals!
BF; ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR!

RC: BF; That was incredible playing, Rock Lobster!
BF; Best party I've been to all year!!
RL: BF; Oh, you know it. Would you expect anything less from THE Rock Lobster?
RC: BF; OH! I've got a radical idea!
BF; Ever heard of the Star Seekers?
RL: BF; Y'know, yeah, I have. I heard a groupie mention it earlier.
RC: BF; Why not join? You can make it so the party never stops, wherever we go!
BF; Constantly surrounded by your adoring fans- what do you say?
RL: BF; For the fans? How can I say no!?
BF; Count me in, party-man.

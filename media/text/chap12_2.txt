CA: ...50 bags of flour, 576 eggs, and 40 pounds of sugar.

But have you heard about the drama with the Star Seekers?
I usually don't divulge in rumors, but this has got me all giddy!
CA: Now now, I have a job to do! Disctractions will lead to distraction.
AL: There's so much intrigue, though!
Space Crab has been gathering members from all over the galaxy.
I might be one, actually. Not sure.
Not only that, but Chrono Crab started a rival group!
CA: I see.

I have a job to do! I'm not off the clock until these 200 cakes are baked.
They are an express order for the grand opening of the Star Seekers!
And the cakes WILL be baked, at any cost!

KN: Tell me, musician - what does being evil mean to you?
RL: Uhhh, bro, who let you backstage?
KN: Does a selfish desire become less so, the more you share it with others?
RL: (calling on phone) Hey, security? There's an old man yapping at me backstage.
KN: This isn't a concern to be pushing off, musician. Someone near and dear to you is in danger.

Hey, you're not thinking of 'taking out' my roommate, are you?!
KN: That is precisely what I hope to do when I find him.
RL: No way I'll let you do that! He pays for half the rent!
You think I make enough dough to live alone? Well, I'm not trying to find out!

I love that dude, but... how do you expect me to fight a guy with a sword?!
KN: Excuses, excuses...
Maybe you should write a song about that, you weakling.

RL: Dang... I could have used some backup from my security.
That Top Crab better have a good reason for leaving me high and dry like this!

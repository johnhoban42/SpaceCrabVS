??: Taxi. I request your services.
TX: BAFF; Uh, sure. I was going to call it quits, but if you're going nearby, I can take you.
NC: BWFB; I do not care to travel. Rather, I want to inquire about the Taxi you drive.
TX: BDFDd; Are you with Ned's Vehicle Inspections?
BHFBa; I already got the car inspected, quit buggin' me about it.
NC: BBFH; I have no affiliates... not anymore.
BSFDd; But you clearly do, based on the contents of your car...

BZFDe; THIS. A Star Seekers poster!
TX: BDFBe; That thing? Some kid left it in here. I don't even know what a Star Seeker is.
NC: BPFA; You may not understand your role in this, but I see it clearly-
BVFB; You're the advertiser.
BOFDd; How many crabs have you driven since this poster was placed?
TX: BAFGe; I don't really keep track of my clients. I've been busy though- a few hundred, maybe?
NC: BHFP; A few HUNDRED?!
BVFB; Your reach is as unparalleled as it is dangerous. While you may remain...
BPFB; The same can not be said about your Taxi.
TX: BNFBa; Hey, hands off the car!
BKFDd; Looks like I need to break it out one more time...
BSFDb; The Taxi Crab Special!

BAFJa; Little guy really got riled up.
BKFGe; The Star Seekers, huh?
BSFJc; Maybe I should check it out, after all.
BKFKh; Gives me a good chance to serve out some 'Taxi Crab Specials', right?

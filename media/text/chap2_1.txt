LW: BDFDa; So, I was given an IMPORTANT task...
BAFJd; Ask ANYONE I can think of to join this 'Star Seekers' group...
BMFU1a; I just have no idea where to start!
AL: BAFUa; If you had no idea where to start, then why did you come bother me?
LW: BOFJ1b; You're the smartest guy I know, you HAVE to have some ideas!
BAFJd; Who should I be asking? The biggest crabs? The tallest crabs?
BCFA1e; Maybe... the SMARTEST crabs?
AL: BAFUa; You're being far more transparent than you typically are.
BAFC; That's Sparse Crab's thing.
BAFU; Is this that big of a deal to you?
LW: BKFA1; Well, yeah, this was a request from THE Space Crab. I can't ignore that!
AL: BAFH; Hmm... I would like to give you an answer, but I'm all booked up.
BMFH; Not only am I supposed to file taxes for Crabacus, but King Crab also booked me for a consultation.
BMFJ; Something about employment rights under a monarchial reign.
LW: BPFB1; Have room for one more appointment? A battle, with me!
BAFA1g; When I win, you'll clear your schedule, and join the Star Seekers!
AL: BAFD; Honestly, that's doubtful. Though, I'll entertain the challenge.

LW: BMFOa; Wait! Al! You left your schedule behind!
BMFJa; ...
BMFU; Crabacus, King Crab...
BIFJc; If these two have Al Legal working for them, they MUST be powerful.
BMFW; Wait, Crabacus...
BAFOf; I went to school with him! They called him a 'Numerical Wizard'!
BOFJ1b; If the Star Seekers want to succeed, they'll need more magicians. He's my top priority!

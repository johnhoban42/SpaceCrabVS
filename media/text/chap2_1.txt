LW: So, I was given an IMPORTANT task...

Ask ANYONE I can think of to join this 'Star Seekers' group...
I just have no idea where to start!
AL: If you had no idea where to start, then why did you come bother me?
LW: You're the smartest guy I know, you HAVE to have some ideas!
Who should I be asking? The biggest crabs? The tallest crabs?
Maybe... the SMARTEST crabs? (schmoozing)
AL: You're being far more transparent than you typically are.
That's Sparse Crab's thing.
Is this that big of a deal to you?
LW: Well, yeah, this was a request from THE Space Crab. I can't ignore that!
AL: Hmm... I would like to give you an answer, but I'm all booked up.
Not only am I supposed to file taxes for Crabicus, but King Crab also booked me for a consultation.
Something about employment rights under a monarchial reign.
LW: Have room for one more appointment? A battle, with me!
When I win, you'll clear your schedule, and join the Star Seekers!
AL: Honestly, that's doubtful. Though, I'll entertain the challenge.

AL: Ah! Bwa-ba-ba-what!?
LW: Yeah, I guess I HAVE been getting pretty good.
AL: This is not what I was expecting. Nope.
Uh. Gotta go! Gotta reschedule! Leaving now!

LW: Wait! Al! You left your schedule behind!

Crabicus, King Crab...
If these two have Al Legal working for them, they MUST be powerful.
Wait, Crabicus...
I went to school with him! They called him a 'Numerical Wizard'!
If the Star Seekers want to succeed, they'll need more magicians. He's my top priority!

AL: Geez, this many appointments in a row left me really, really tired.
But just one crab left to meet with.
The one who got away... Crabacus?!

CB: That's right, it's ME!
I decided to QUIT the Star Seekers, and I'm NEVER coming back!
AL: B-but you HAVE to! Space Crab needs you! I'm contractually obligated to get you back!
CB: Do you think I CARE about your stupid legal documents? Don't make me laugh.
The law is an outdated tool that cowards throw around, without fully realizing it's awesome power.
So just GIVE UP! You're powerless against my conviction and my word!

Ha ha ha... do you think that words alone are enough to stop me?
I WIELD words as my weapon of choice!
CB: No! You can't be serious!
AL: It's my job to be serious.
As long as the spark of justice lives within me, I have the power to keep going.
My passion for doing what's right won't be extinguished by ANYTHING!

AL: ZZZ... zzz...
CB: Hello? Is this the office of Al Legal?
AL: Huh? Wuzzut? Yes. Yes.
CB: Sorry, did I wake you up?
You looked like you were sleeping hard. Like you were sleeping... determined?
AL: (So it was all a dream...)
Many apologies. Let me pull up your case...
Space Crab would like to formally apologize for the unwanted responsibilities pushed upon you.
I've taken the liberty of re-drafting your contract, with constraints placed on expected contributions.
If you sign, both parties will be in agreement, and we'll be all done here.
CB: I've got to say, I'm impressed. This is way more thorough than I expected.
And this 'no-math' clause is exactly what I wanted.
Thanks for making this so simple & easy! I'm glad there wasn't any drama.
AL: Yeah, I'm glad, too...
(Someday, I'll get the dramatic court case of my dreams...)
(But for now, I'll perform my duty as Al Legal, Attorney at Claw!)

CB: BUFQa; That's right, it's ME!
BAFL; I decided to QUIT the Star Seekers, and I'm NEVER coming back!
AL: BSFKc; B-but you HAVE to! Space Crab needs you! I'm contractually obligated to get you back!
CB: BUFKh; Do you think I CARE about your stupid legal documents? Don't make me laugh.
BAFWa; The law is an outdated tool that cowards throw around, without fully realizing it's awesome power.
BIFKg; So just GIVE UP! You're powerless against my conviction and my word!

AL: BBFTr; ZZZ... zzz...
CB: BIFJb; Hello? Is this the office of Al Legal?
AL: BAFV; Huh? Wuzzut? Yes. Yes.
CB: BBFEb; Sorry, did I wake you up?
BNFFd; You looked like you were sleeping hard. Like you were sleeping... determinedly?
AL: BBFHa; (So it was all a dream...)
BAFJd; Many apologies. Let me pull up your case...
BMFJe; Space Crab would like to formally apologize for the unwanted responsibilities pushed upon you.
BZFW; I've taken the liberty of re-drafting your contract, with constraints placed on expected contributions.
BZFJd; If you sign, both parties will be in agreement, and we'll be all done here.
CB: BUFA; I've got to say, I'm impressed. This is way more thorough than I expected.
BSFAe; And this 'no-math' clause is exactly what I wanted.
BAFO; Thanks for making this so simple & easy! I'm glad there wasn't any drama.
AL: BBFH; Yeah, I'm glad, too...
BVFD; (Someday, I'll get the dramatic court case of my dreams...)
BOFQa; (But for now, I'll perform my duty as Al Legal, Attorney at Claw!)

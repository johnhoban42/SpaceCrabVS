CA: A customer, a customer!
Welcome to Crab Cake's Confectionaries!
SC: Hello! I placed on order online, is it ready for pickup?
CA: Hmmm, I don't remember seeing any...
SC: Really? Nothing under the name Space Crab?

CA: ...Oh.
Funny story, really.

I thought it was a prank order.
THE Space Crab? Ordering at MY humble bakery?!
Ho! Ha! A real riot! Surely the work of a prankster at large.
SC: It's not a prank, though.
I NEED those sweets for the opening of the Star Seekers!
CA: Well, I can put in the request as a rush. Just this once.
What was in your original order?
SC: A- ah- a cake? Uhh...
I forgot. I KNEW this would happen. That's why I did the online order!
CA: Oh dear. Why don't we give you the old memory-jogger special?

CA: ... (aggresive look of dissapproval)
Wonderful. Thank you.

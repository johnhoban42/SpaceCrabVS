RC: Oh... okay. Sure.
MC: This- this feels wrong.
Seeing the happiest, go luckiest guy I know, turned into some moping sad sack...

It makes me MAD!
RAVE CRAB! Who did this to you?!
RC: I guess, maybe it was Space Crab.
But it wasn't really anyone's fault-

This group of DELINQUENT CRABS up here better know what's up.
Hey, CLAWHEADS! Where's Space Crab? I have a bone to pick.
LW: Delinquents? That's a bit harsh...
CA: I contain no claws in my head, your recipe must be mistaken!

If you continue to harass my subjects, then please enjoy your long stay in the Star Seekers dungeon.

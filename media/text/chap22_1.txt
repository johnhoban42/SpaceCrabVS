SC: BAFCd; So this is it then, huh?
AL: BAFJ; That's right, Space Crab. Your last appointment.
BWFHa; After this, all paperwork will be filed, and then...
BIFAb; The Star Seekers will be complete. Every crab, contractually on board.
BMFH; Now bringing in the final crab - your Number One Fan Crab.

SC: BMFJa; Thanks, Al. I'm ready when he is.

BAFEa; Hey, listen-

1F: BIFIa; Maaan, this is awkward.
BBFI; I was kind of, really, super obsessed with you for a while.
BSFEb; And MAYBE, that made me overreact a bit when the whole Star Seekers thing started.
SC: BBFH; Listen, about that-
1F: BAFV; I felt like you didn't want me in the group! A real 'never meet your heroes' case, huh?
SC: BMFFd; I didn't even know you back then. If I had-
1F: BVFTq; So that's why I turned to Chrono Crab. He made me feel so accepted!
BBFTn; Being on the team, one that was so anti-YOU, it was empowering.
BVFDb; But him, Jeff, Team Player - they helped me see the light.

BWFEb; I'm no longer YOUR number one fan...

BIFQa; Now, Chrono Crab is NUMBER ONE in my eyes!!
SC: BHFP; WHAT?!
BUFDe; I'm way cooler than him! Don't you remember all that stuff from Space Crab 2?
1F: BMFB; Were YOU the one who rescued me from the Mirror Dimension? I don't think so.
BIFKh; Face it. To me, you've been off screen this whole time. Chrono Crab is my true idol.
BKFL; And I'll carry on the Star Destroyers in his name. I'll carry on the rivalry!
SC: BVFDe; Don't call me lame yet! I'll show you a FRACTION of the cool skills I've picked up from the Star Seekers!

1F: BAFU; I gotta be honest, Space Crab...
BMFAd; Yeah. That was really cool.
BKFSa; To be beaten up by my childhood idol... wow!
SC: BDFHa; (Childhood? Space Crab 2 wasn't THAT long ago...)
BBFKc; (Was it?)
1F: BAFA; All right. I'll be your fan again!
BMFGb; I'm not sure who will end up being my Number One, but I'll join the Star Seekers to keep an eye out!
BKFO; See you soon. I'm excited for what comes next!
exit 2
SC: BBFAb; Wow...
BAFJb; Now that #1 Fan Crab is onboard, EVERY crab I've met is in.
BVFOd; So that means, the Star Seekers are fully formed!

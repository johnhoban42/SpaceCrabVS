SC: So this is it then, huh?
AL: That's right, Space Crab. Your last appointment.
After this, all paperwork will be filed, and then...
The Star Seekers will be complete. Every crab, contractually on board.
Now bringing in the final crab - your Number One Fan Crab.

Thanks, Al. I'm ready when he is.

SC: ...
Hey, listen-

1F: Maaan, this is awkward.
I was kind of, really, super obsessed with you for a while.
And MAYBE, that made me overreact a bit when the whole Star Seekers thing started.
SC: Listen, about that-
1F: I felt like you didn't want me in the group! A real 'never meet your heroes' case, huh?
SC: I didn't even know you back then. If I had-
1F: So that's why I turned to Chrono Crab. He made me feel so accepted!
Being on the team, one that was so anti-YOU, it was empowering.
But him, Jeff, Team Player - they helped me see the light.

I'm no longer YOUR number one fan...

Now, Chrono Crab is NUMBER ONE in my eyes!!
SC: WHAT?!
I'm way cooler than him! Don't you remember all that stuff from Space Crab 2?
1F: Were YOU the one who rescued me from the Mirror Dimension? I don't think so.
Face it. To me, you've been off screen this whole time. Chrono Crab is my true idol.
And I'll carry on the Star Destroyers in his name. I'll carry on the rivalry!
SC: Don't call me lame yet! I'll show you a FRACTION of the cool skills I've picked up from the Star Seekers!

1F: I gotta be honest, Space Crab...
Yeah. That was really cool.
To be beaten up by my childhood idol... wow!
SC: (Childhood? Space Crab 2 wasn't THAT long ago...)
(Was it?)
1F: All right. I'll be your fan again!
I'm not sure who will end up being my Number One, but I'll join the Star Seekers to keep an eye out!
See you soon. I'm excited for what comes next!

SC: Wow...
Now that #1 Fan Crab is onboard, EVERY crab I've met is in.
So that means, the Star Seekers are fully formed!

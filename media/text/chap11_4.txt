NC: Space Crab. I have questions to resolve with you.
SC: Oh, you're the one who works under King Crab, right?
NC: My details are to be spared for the moment.
This concerns you.
Why did you create the Star Seekers?
SC: Philisophical, aren't you?
Hmm... well, I don't have much of a reason.
The Star Seekers do what I normally do, just with some more crabs.
I guess, I was a bit lonely, exporing out on my own.

Admittedly, your answer is frank.
I too, understand the lonelyness that space can bring.
But-

NC: Your intentions have been proven.
Your Star Seekers have no relation to past efforts.
Moreover, your intentions certainly not are coming from a place of malice.
My own mission has proven to be fruitless, ending in wasted time and my own embarresment.

NC: Hmm?
SC: We've both felt lonliness out in space, right?
The Star Seekers have helped me feel connected, in a way I couldn't imagine.
If I can offer you a way to feel that way too, then I need to do it.
NC: Very well. I accept.
SC: Aw yeah!
Doesn't this feel great? We have so many members now!
I'm getting addicted to this feeling! We NEED more crabs!!
NC: If this will ease the lonliness of other crabs, then I am on board with this mission.

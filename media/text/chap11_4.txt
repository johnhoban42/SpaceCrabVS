NC: BAFD; Space Crab. I have questions to resolve with you.
SC: BAFJa; Oh, you're the one who works under King Crab, right?
NC: BPFB; My details are to be spared for the moment. This concerns you.
BAFW; Why did you create the Star Seekers?
SC: BCFIa; Philosophical, aren't you?
BMFHa; Hmm... well, I didn't have much of a reason.
BAFJd; The Star Seekers do what I normally do, just with some company.
BBFEb; I guess, I was a bit lonely, exploring out on my own.

NC: BBFTr; Your intentions have been proven.
BQFYb; The new Star Seekers have no relation to past efforts.
BQFYf; Moreover, your intentions certainly are not coming from a place of malice.

NC: BBFF; Hmm?
SC: BBFEb; We've both felt loneliness out in space, right?
BAFEc; The Star Seekers have helped me feel connected, in a way I didn't expect.
BMFEb; If I can offer you a way to feel that too, then I need to do it.
NC: BBFTn; Very well. I accept.
SC: BKFOa; Aw yeah!
BAFO; Doesn't this feel great? We have so many members now!
BSFKd; I'm getting addicted to this feeling! We NEED more crabs!!
NC: BMFD; If this will ease the loneliness of other crabs, then I am on board with this mission.

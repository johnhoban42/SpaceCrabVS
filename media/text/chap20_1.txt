KN: A knight's sense of justice isn't only used for long monologues.
It's also for sensing disturbances in the universe.
And there is quite a disturbance occurring.
A tear in space-time... no... a deliberate rip?!
You there! Wooden boy!
TC: What? Who? Oh! You mean me?
KN: We once battled - remember? You were causing a 'disturbance' on my lawn.
You were so afraid of me, hahaha!
TC: Uh, yeah. I guess I was. Haha...
KN: This is no time for joking. This is a matter of life and death.
TC: Oh! Sorry.
KN: I have a mission for you to carry out - let's see if your power is worthy of it!

KN: As to be expected, you were unable to compare to the full might of my strength.
TC: Aw geez, you were WAY tougher than the last time we fought...
KN: Well, of course. I was actually trying this time.
And I must! For this is a matter of life and death.
Though your power isn't comparable to mine, it is measurable to the finest mercenaries I know.
Here is your mission.
Top Crab, you must gather all the crabs you can into the safety of the Star Seekers.
The strength in numbers will be enough protection for those who are unable to fight for themselves.
A great evil is emerging... we need to do all we can to prepare.
Stay safe, Top Crab.

KN: B0MFA; A knight's sense of justice isn't only used for long monologues.
B0IFW; It's also for sensing disturbances in the universe.
BSFOg; And there is quite a disturbance occurring.
B0AFH; A tear in space-time... no... a deliberate rip?!
BOFD; You there! Wooden boy!
TC: BAFJa; What? Who? Oh! You mean me?
KN: B0MFA; We once battled - remember? You were causing a 'disturbance' on my lawn.
B0BFOe; You were so afraid of me, hahaha!
TC: BDFI; Uh, yeah. I guess I was. Haha...
KN: BAFQ; This is no time for joking. This is a matter of life and death.
TC: BSFHj; Oh! Sorry.
KN: BZFD; I have a mission for you to carry out - let's see if your power is worthy of it!

KN: BMFUa; As to be expected, you were unable to compare to the full might of my strength.
TC: BBFKc; Aw geez, you were WAY tougher than the last time we fought...
KN: BAFO; Well, of course. I was actually trying this time.
BMFMa; And I must! For this is a matter of life and death.
BOFD; Though your power isn't comparable to mine, it is measurable to the finest mercenaries I know.
BAFA; Here is your mission.
BVFA; Top Crab, you must gather all the crabs you can into the safety of the Star Seekers.
BOFA; The strength in numbers will be enough protection for those who are unable to fight for themselves.
BZFA; A great evil is emerging... we need to do all we can to prepare.
BZFD; Stay safe, Top Crab.

HC: This has been a wonderful time, visiting paradise.
Even though things haven't gone as... expected.
Luckily, tonight is going to be calm and relaxing- the sunset luau.
For once on this vacation, things will finally go as planned.
There it is!
I finally made it, to my final item on my itinerary-

Haahaha! Sure, why not?
I've been too worried about how things are supposed to go.
Time to let loose and have some fun!
RC: Attaboy! Loosen up, party hard, live free!
Just for fun, a dance battle, you and me!

HC: Dancing the night away really was a great time.
I can't believe I was so worried about the small things.
And that's how I ended the best vacation of my life!
TX: ...That's great, sir.
HC: How much farther is the trip home?
TX: Another two lightyears, sir.
HC: Not bad at all! Only one short nap away.

(Maybe I should book a vacation.)

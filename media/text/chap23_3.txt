S8: Space renowned legal man, Al Legal-
I'm giving YOU permission to publish my song!
AL: Sir, you can't just walk into an active meeting.
1F: We're in the middle of getting the Space Crab documentary approved!
Don't blow this for us!
S8: Documentaries come out all the time! Al Legal has the ultimate opportunity-
Publishing the soon-to-be #1 punk song in the galaxy, 'Sk8r Zoea'!
AL: You thought you'd be able to waltz into my office and demand a contract?
S8: Yes! And I still think that, even now. I'll show you my conviction!

AL: Alright. I've heard the song.
But... I'm going to be saying no to this pitch.
S8: I knew it; it's the name, right?
If 'Sk8r Zoea' doesn't work, I have another name I can use.
AL: The name is hardly the issue.
It's more an issue of your blatant unprofessionalism.
S8: Oh, I get it. There's no place for rebels in the mainstream, is that it?
Then FINE! I'll start my OWN record label!

1F: ...Y'know, Al, I thought of a cool name for the documentary.
'Far Flung Dreams - The Coolest Crab's Quest for Galactic Cooperation'!
AL: #1 Fan Crab... I think you could do with a dash of professionalism, too.

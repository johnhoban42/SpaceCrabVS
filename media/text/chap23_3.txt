BOFB; I'm giving YOU permission to publish my song!

1F: BAFJd; We're in the middle of getting the Space Crab documentary approved!
BMFDd; Don't blow this for me!
S8: BUFGb; Documentaries come out all the time! Al Legal has the ultimate opportunity-
BVFKh; Publishing the soon-to-be #1 punk song in the galaxy, 'Sk8r Zoea'!
AL: BBFUa; You thought you'd be able to waltz into my office and demand a contract?
S8: BAFQb; Yes! And I still think that, even now. I'll show you my conviction!

AL: BAFJ; Alright. I've heard the song.
BMFDa; But... I'm going to be saying no to this pitch.
S8: BDFEb; I knew it- it's the name, right?
BSFIa; If 'Sk8r Zoea' doesn't work, I have another name I can use.
AL: BBFUa; The name is hardly the issue.
BAFWa; It's more an issue of your blatant unprofessionalism.
S8: BUFDe; Oh, I get it. There's no place for rebels in the mainstream, is that it?
BAFOh; Then FINE! I'll start my OWN record label!

SC: BBFRb; Hey. Al. I hope I don't need an appointment or anything.
AL: BAFSa; Space Crab!
BF; Ah- ahem - Space Crab. What can I help you with?
SC: BF; Al... I messed up.
BF; The Star Seekers were all together, and I couldn't control myself...
AL: BF; (Oh, the latest update on the Star Seekers!)
BF; (I've been behind on the news- what exciting developments have occurred?)
SC: BF; ...and now everything is falling apart.
AL: BF; No! Really?
SC: BF; Yeah. And that's why I came here - for your help.
BF; I can't do that logistical stuff. That's part of why it ended up like this in the first place.
BF; So, will you do it?
AL: BF; (No way. I get to play a part in the Star Seekers?!)
BF; (Don't blow this, Al. Follow protocol.)
BF; Well, we do have a payment fee for these things.
BF; I'm pretty sure you already know what it is.

SC: BCF; Shoot... I had to win that one, didn't I?
AL: BF; N-not at all! In fact, your payment's been processed.
BF; Al Legal is at your service, ready to help the Star Seekers however I can.
SC: BF; You seem... a little too eager?
BF; ...
BF; That's great! Everything is a colossal mess, so your help is greatly appreciated.
AL: BF; Wait. How big of a mess do you mean?

AL: Things have been... quiet, around here.
Like every crab suddenly decided that they don't need my services anymore.
...
It's peaceful, yet quite boring.

SC: Hey, Al. I hope I don't need an appointment or anything.
AL: Space Crab!
Ah- ahem - Space Crab. What can I help you with?
SC: Al... I messed up.
The Star Seekers were all together, and I couldn't control myself...
AL: (Oh, the latest update on the Star Seekers!)
(I've been behind on the news- what exciting developments have occurred?)
SC: ...and now everything is falling apart.
AL: No! Really?
SC: Yeah. And that's why I came here - for your help.
I can't do that logistical stuff. That's part of why it ended up like this in the first place.
So, will you do it?
AL: (No. Way. I get to play a part in the Star Seekers?!)
(Don't blow this, Al. Follow protocol.)
Well, we do have a payment fee for these things.
I'm pretty sure you already know what it is.

SC: Shoot... I had to win that one, didn't I?
AL: N-not at all! In fact, your payment's been processed.
Al Legal is at your service, ready to help the Star Seekers however I can.
SC: You seem... a little too eager?
...
That's great! Everything is a colossal mess, so your help is greatly appreciated.
AL: Wait. How big of a mess do you mean?

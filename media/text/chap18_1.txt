SC: BBFRb; Hey. Al. I hope I don't need an appointment or anything.
AL: BAFSa; Space Crab!
BMFWa; Ah- ahem - Space Crab. What can I help you with?
SC: BAFEa; Al... I messed up.
BSFEd; The Star Seekers were all together, and one thing led to another...
AL: BVFS; (Oh, the latest update on the Star Seekers!)
BUFOf; (I've been behind on the news- what exciting developments have occurred?)
SC: BBFV; ...and now everything is falling apart.
AL: BHFPa; No! Really?!
SC: BVFEa; Yeah. And that's why I came here - for your help.
BMFJd; I can't do that logistical stuff. That's part of why it ended up like this in the first place.
BVFDa; So, will you help me?
AL: BTFNe; (No way. I get to play a part in the Star Seekers?!)
BTFNc; (Don't blow this, Al. Follow protocol.)
BAFH; W-well, we do have a payment fee for these things.
BVFWa; I'm pretty sure you already know what it is.

SC: BCFIa; Shoot... I had to win that one, didn't I?
AL: BSFKc; N-not at all! In fact, your, uh, payment's been processed.
BMFOc; Al Legal is at your service, ready to help the Star Seekers however I can.
SC: BAFJa; You seem... a little too eager?
BUFC; ...
BAFO; That's great! Everything is a colossal mess, so your help is greatly appreciated.
AL: BBFKi; Wait. How big of a mess do you mean?

S8: You, G, you've gotta publish my song!
It'll fit right along with your other ones!
RL: My security must be awful if cretins like you can get past it.

Just imagine what they'll say: 'New hit single- Sk8r Zoea! Backed by Rock Lobster!'

RL: And the name is trash, too. Who even knows what a zoea is?
CB: Well, a 'Zoea' is a another name for a young crab, so-
RL: Crabacus! I didn't hire you to validate the crazies.
Actually, I hired you for security. Why are you backstage with us?
S8: I think you're going to like my song! I'm not leaving until you hear it.
RL: You're the worst type of fan, you know that?

S8: Admit it, you're smitten.
RL: Well, I've gotta be honest, kid...
I couldn't hear it over you HURLING METEORS AT ME!
CB: I thought it sounded fun!
S8: See, Rock Lobster? You'd be an IDIOT to not sign my song.
RL: So you sneak in, pretend you're a fan, and then insult me to my face?
You're nothing but a wannabe. A poser.
S8: ME? You think I'm a POSER?!
You've insulted me. I don't even want your dumb publishing deal anymore.

S8: BMFQa; You, G, you've gotta publish my song! It'll fit right along with your other ones!
RL: BBFUa; My security must be awful if cretins like you can get past it.
S8: BUFOe; Would I really be stupid if I was coming to YOU for help?

CB: BSFGb; Well, a 'Zoea' is a another name for a young crab, so-
RL: BMFM; Crabacus! I didn't hire you to validate the crazies.
BAFDe; Actually, I hired you for security. Why are you backstage with us?
S8: BIFQb; I think you're going to like my song! I'm not leaving until you hear it.

S8: BUFOe; Admit it, you're smitten.

CB: BIFJb; I thought it sounded fun!
S8: BDFB; See, Rock Lobster? You'd be an IDIOT to not sign my song.
RL: BMFDd; So you sneak in, pretending to be a fan, and then insult me to my face?
BBFD; You're nothing but a wannabe. A poser.
S8: BHFP; ME? You think I'm a POSER?!
BMFDa; You've insulted me. I don't even want your dumb publishing deal anymore.

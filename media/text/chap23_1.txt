S8: BF; You, G, you've gotta publish my song! It'll fit right along with your other ones!
RL: BF; My security must be awful if cretins like you can get past it.

BF; Just imagine what they'll say: 'New hit single- Sk8r Zoea! Backed by Rock Lobster!'
RL: BF; You have no idea how the music industry works.
RL: BF; And the name is trash, too. Who even knows what a zoea is?
CB: BF; Well, a 'Zoea' is a another name for a young crab, so-
RL: BF; Crabacus! I didn't hire you to validate the crazies.
BF; Actually, I hired you for security. Why are you backstage with us?
S8: BF; I think you're going to like my song! I'm not leaving until you hear it.
RL: BF; You're the worst type of fan, you know that?

S8: BF; Admit it, you're smitten.
RL: BF; Well, I've gotta be honest, kid...
BF; I couldn't hear it over you HURLING METEORS AT ME!
CB: BF; I thought it sounded fun!
S8: BF; See, Rock Lobster? You'd be an IDIOT to not sign my song.
RL: BF; So you sneak in, pretend you're a fan, and then insult me to my face?
BF; You're nothing but a wannabe. A poser.
S8: BF; ME? You think I'm a POSER?!
BF; You've insulted me. I don't even want your dumb publishing deal anymore.

FC: BAFA; Salutations, Rock Shrimp.
RL: BBFWa; It's Rock Lobster.
FC: BCFEb; Well, you can forgive an old man's poor memory, can't you?
BDFJd; I have a... music question, if you'll entertain it.
RL: BMFAe; You know who you're talking to, right? The music guy. Ask away.
FC: BAFGe; Well, that music that played when I fought Space Crab?
BSFJb; I quite liked it. Think you can play it again?
RL: BUFTp; Oh. No-can-do, compadre.
FC: BMFEa; But why not, Rock Hermit Crab?
RL: BMFDe; LOBSTER. Rock LOBSTER.
BAFJa; I can't play it because I didn't make that song.
BMFDa; I only make the songs with the guitars in them, yeah?
BAFGd; Crustacean Station, Starlight Rivals, Sunset Siesta...
BUFDa; I've got a style. Listen for it next time.
FC: BAFJa; Well, maybe you have a CD with it, then?
BUFHa; I've searched the rest of the story mode, and I couldn't find that song anywhere else...
BAFJd; I really am quite desperate.
RL: BBFOj; Yuck. Asking a rockstar to ignore his musicianship, and play a CD instead?
BAFTq; You sicken me. But, for the founder of the Star Seekers...
BMFAe; We'll give it a whirl.

FC: BUFJb; I appreciate you humoring me.
BAFJa; Still, I'm surprised... I always thought you wrote ALL of the Space Crab music.
RL: BMFJb; You think I can power the whole Galactic Radio by myself?
BAFOe; I'm flattered, but that just isn't the case.
BMFJa; Commander Crab's the one who wrote that battle song just now- 'Fight for the Future'.
BIFJb; Bowling Crab, Train Crab, Ragtime Crab, and Flute Crab also lent their talents to the radio.
BAFAa; Keep an ear out for them.
FC: BAFJb; How insightful... the music of Space Crab sure is amazing, isn't it, Rock Lobber?
RL: BMFKh; It's Rock Lobs- eh, close enough. Rock on, old crab.

RL: Moving on to our next song-
MC: Hey. Hey! HEY!
What's the big idea? Why so LOUD?!
RL: Oh, Mad Crab! Finally come around to my music, eh?
Ready to admit your LOVE for my sweet melodies~?
MC: Ready? I'm READY to RIP that guitar out of your claws and SMASH it on the ground!
Who gave YOU permission to ruin the peace and quiet?
RL: Wait. Did you not know about the concert?
MC: Of COURSE I know about the concert, you dolt. That's why-
RL: A madly in love fan, too ashamed to admit their feelings. How cliche~
MC: Quit it with the fantasies. You. Me. Fight.
When I win, you go.
RL: Hey, all good with me. I won't be losing with my next song.
Sunset Siesta, here we go!
I think you'll like this one, Maddy~

RL: Hey, a little lover's quarrel never hurt anyone, right?
MC: Ugh.
I specifically planned my trip so that I WOULDN'T be here for your nonsense.
You rockstars think you can make a ruckus wherever and whenever...
It makes me hopping MAD!
Just... let me go in peace.
...
And send me an MP3 of that song you just played.

RC: Heh... I can read you like a book, Mad Crab.

NC: Here I stand, directionless and confused.
Am I doomed to wander the stars, with no partner leading me towards honor?

HL: My word, you really are a rambunctious child...
NC: ...
HL: It's no wonder that you put so much stock in the words and guidance of your friends.
Channeling your boundless energy towards the support of a cause is really quite cute.
NC: Nghh... not... really...
HL: Do not fret. The path you were previously on is not one of self destruction.
Stay the course, and all will be well. Your Star Seekers are not bound by the fate of your ancestors.
I sense good in Space Crab's heart. If he can cleanse the unhealthy desires from around it...
The two of you will live a long, happy life together.

CN: Geez... I acted like a total baka back there.
I shouldn't waste my chances - it's not like another hunk will show up out of nowhere.

SB: Bark!

CN: OH MY GAAAHHH!
You're so... SO...
Hot! Cute! The guy of my dreams!
SB: Woof.
CN: But... I know we can't be together.
SB: Arf?
CN: Because... you don't even have 6 legs!!
I can't be seen with you in public! ESPECIALLY not at prom.
But, the heart wants what the heart wants.
OOHHH, why is this so HARD?
SB: Bark!
CN: You're going to BREAK my HEART if you don't stop!
SB: Woof.
CN: LEAVE ME ALONE!!

SB: Arf!
CN: I think I understand. While we can't be together, our feelings will still persist.
SB: Woof...
CN: I'll come back for you!
Once prom is over, and I work up the courage to speak my heart...
We'll be together forever!!!
SB: Bark!

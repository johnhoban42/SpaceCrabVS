SC: BAFC; Hmm, Ladder Wizard was my only lead for potential Star Seekers.
BDFEd; I mean, I've MET a lot of crabs, but I don't know any THAT well.
BBFHa; The only guy whose phone number I actually have saved is Space Ned.
BAFCe; It's not like a crab's going to appear out of nowhere, wanting to join the Star Seekers.
BBFJ; ...Right?
BAFIa; Dang, I thought that would work.
??: Wh-whoa! Watch out!
SC: BBFSa; (Holy Crab, thank you!)
TC: BAFT; Sorry! Sorry. I have such a hard time keeping control.
BAFEd; Balancing isn't my strong suit. 
BYFZ; WhOAH!
SC: BAFCb; No worries, kid. Say, if it's stability you want-
TC: BSFT; Sorry, I can't hear you! I'm spinning way too fast!
BAFJe; Please knock me down so we can talk!
BYFZ; PL-PLEASE!

TC: BZFh; Whew, what a relief! I could get used to this kind of steadiness.
SC: BAFA; Well, if you want steady, why not join the Star Seekers?
BLFAb; While we plan on discovering the wonderous unknown...
You'll always have a reliable group of crabs to back you up!
TC: BZFE; Wow! A group like that exists? Count me in!
SC: BIFT; Really? Cool! Very cool!
TC: BZFj; I want to ask, though- can my friend join, too?
BZFo; Well, maybe he's not my 'friend'...
BZFe; I do owe him a favor though. Can you consider it?
SC: BLFO; Consider it done!
BAFQb; (Boy, things have gone great for the Star Seekers so far!)
BAFOc; (What could possibly mess it up now?)

SC: Hmm, Ladder Wizard was my only real lead.
I mean, I've MET a lot of crabs, but I don't know them THAT well.
The only guy who's phone number I actually have saved is Space Ned.
It's not like a crab's just going to appear out of nowhere, wanting to join the Star Seekers.
...Right?
Dang, I thought that would work.
??: Wh-whoa! Watch out!
SC: (Thank you lady luck!)
TC: Sorry! Sorry. I have such a hard time keeping control.
Balancing isn't my strong suit. 
WhOAH!
SC: No worries, kid. Say, if it's stability you want-
TC: Sorry, I can't hear you! I'm spinning way too fast!
Please knock me down so we can talk!
PL-PLEASE!

TC: Whew, what a relief! I could get used to this kind of steadiness.
SC: Well, if you want steady, why not join the Star Seekers?
While we plan on discovering wonderous new places,
you'll always have a steady group of crabs to back you up!
TC: Wow! A group like that exists? Count me in!
SC: Really? Cool! Very cool!
TC: I want to ask, though- can my friend join, too?
Well, maybe he's not my 'friend'...
I do owe him a favor though. Can you consider it?
SC: Consider it done!
(Boy, things have gone great for the Star Seekers so far!)
(What could possibly mess it up now?)

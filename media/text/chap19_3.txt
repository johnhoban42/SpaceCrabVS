SB: Is that another crab? My, this walk is turning out to be truly exciting.
No... this isn't any ordinary crab...
CR: Snip!
SB: This is... the most beautiful crab I've ever laid my eyes on.
While the sight of you makes my heart still, I still feel it beating far out of my chest.
This must be the beautiful contradiction of love.
CR: Snip...
SB: But that look on your face... there must be a complication.
Alas, love can never be this simple!
I've heard the stories, but to experience a lover's dilemma... oh, the pain.
CR: Snip! SNIP!
SB: Do what you have to do. For love, I'll follow any path I must to win your heart.

CR: Snip...
SB: Oh my... it seems our feelings have been communicated through the flow of our fight.
Do you truly believe that a relationship between us is doomed to fail?
CR: Snip.
SB: No. That's my own defeatist mindset, poisoning the well of my soul.
A time will come, when we can truly be happy together...
Until then, my love! I must put you out of my mind, for my own sanity.

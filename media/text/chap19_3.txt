SB: BCFBd; Is that another crab? My, this walk is turning out to be truly exciting.
BEFAd; No... this isn't any ordinary crab...
CN: BKFSa; Snip!
SB: BAFA; This is... the most beautiful crab I've ever laid my eyes on.
BEFAh; While the sight of you makes my heart still, I still feel it beating far out of my chest.
BEFA; This must be the beautiful contradiction of love.

SB: BBFB; But that look on your face... there must be a complication.
BDFDc; Alas, love can never be this simple!
BHFF; I've heard the stories, but to experience a lover's dilemma... oh, the pain.
CN: BHFTj; Snip! SNIP!
SB: BHFFb; Do what you have to do. For love, I'll follow any path I must to win your heart.

CN: BBFEa; Snip...
SB: BBFB; Oh my... it seems our feelings have been communicated through the flow of our fight.

SB: BHFFb; No. That's my own defeatist mindset, poisoning the well of my soul.
BEFAd; A time will come, when we can truly be happy together...
BEFAc; Until then, my love! I must put you out of my mind, for my own sanity.

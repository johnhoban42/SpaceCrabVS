AL: BAFWa; Ladder Wizard. Please, step into my office.
LW: BVFA1g; Al Legal! It's been a while, huh?
BUFA1a; Reconsidered my offer to join the Star Seekers?
AL: BAFJd; That's actually why I've summoned you today.
BSFCd; Not about MY joining, but the multitudes of other crabs you've roped into this.
BMFJa; You see, after asking me, you followed up with an unprecedented number of other crustaceans.
BZFDb; And I have the eyewitness accounts to prove it.
LW: BMFJ1b; Oh, count me as one of the witnesses too! 
AL: BBFUa; ...Of course.
BAFW; If you'd like to speed things along, you can also provide the terms you gave these crabs.
LW: BBFC1d; Terms?
AL: BUFA; Of course. For new members, we need a contract in place, so that all expectations are aligned.
LW: BBFG; You know, Al, this kind of all happened a while ago. The things I said...
BAFJd; Let's just say that they're 'lost to time'.
AL: BBFUa; *sigh* Is there ANY way for you to remember what you told them?
LW: BMFA1; Well, let's retrace my steps!

LW: BSFA1; It's all coming back...
AL: BAFT; Alright, let's hear those terms and conditions!
LW: BMFOc; That's the funny thing - I told them all something different!
BUFO; In lawyer speak, I guess that means they all have DIFFERENT terms, right?
AL: BBFKc; So, we need... individualized contracts... for ALL of them?!
LW: BUFA1g; Wow, that's a lot! With that much work, you'll have no choice but to stay with the Star Seekers!
AL: BBFOj; Ugh... I should have just joined when I first had the chance.
BBFTp; It would have saved me a lot of headache.

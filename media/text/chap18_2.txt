AL: Ladder Wizard. Please, step into my office.
LW: Al Legal! It's been a while, huh?
Reconsidered my offer to join the Star Seekers?
AL: That's actually why I've summoned you today.
Not about MY joining, but the multitudes of other crabs you've roped into this.
You see, after asking me, you followed up with an unprecedented number of other crustaceans.
And I have the eyewitness accounts to prove it.
LW: Oh, count me as one of the witnesses too! 
AL: ...of course.
If you'd like to speed things along, you can also provide the terms you gave these crabs.
LW: Terms?
AL: Of course. For new members, we need a contract in place, so that all expectations are aligned.
LW: You know, Al, this kind of all happened a while ago. The things I said...
Let's just say that they're 'lost to time'.
AL: sigh Is there ANY way for you to remember what you told them?
LW: Well, let's retrace our steps!

LW: It's all coming back...
AL: Alright, let's hear those terms and conditions!
That's the funny thing - I told them all something different!
In lawyer speak, I guess that means they all have different terms, right?
AL: So, we need... individualized contracts... for ALL of them?!
LW: Wow, that's a lot! With that much work, you'll have no choice but to stay with the Star Seekers!
AL: Ugh... I should have just joined when I first had the chance.
It would have saved me a lot of headache.

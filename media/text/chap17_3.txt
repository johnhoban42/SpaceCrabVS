HL: BAFJa; Oh my. The lack of light in this area is quite alarming.
BDFAd; Young man, can you please light the path forward for me?
RC: B0BFEb; I used to glow.
B0BFEa; Now... not so much.
HL: BUFJb; If you're unable to light the way for another, how will you light the way for yourself?
RC: B0SFEd; Huh? I don't get it.
HL: BAFAd; Maybe it will make sense if you shine some light on the situation?
RC: B0MFEb; Hey, I get what you're trying to do. Thanks.
B0BFEd; I just haven't felt like myself since the Star Seeker stuff happened.
HL: BSFTp; It can take time to recover after an impactful event.
BMFTn; I'm sure that everyone is working to right their wrongs.
BAFWv; As for you... can you turn on your lights, just this time? For me?

HL: BVFWv; My child, the time will come when this will be a distant memory.
BAFTn; Begin now, and every day will get easier.

RC: BMFEb; That crab was right. The time that I need to move on, starts... now.
HL: BUFWy; And no cheating. Don't get that time bending fellow involved.
RC: BAFJa; Oh. No, don't worry, I won't!

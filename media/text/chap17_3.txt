HL: Oh my. The lack of light in this area is quite alarming.
Young man, can you please light the path forward for me?
RC: I used to glow.
Now... not so much.
HL: If you're unable to light the way for another, how will you light the way for yourself?
RC: Huh? I don't get it.
HL: Maybe it will make sense if you shine some light on the situation?
RC: Hey, I get what you're trying to do. Thanks.
I just haven't felt like myself since the Star Seeker stuff happened.
HL: It can take time to recover after an impactful event.
I'm sure that everyone is working to right their wrongs.
As for you... can you turn on your lights, just this time? For me?
RC: ...
Sure. I'll give it a shot.

HL: Congratulations, on taking the first step to moving on.
Will you be alright, on your journey of healing?
RC: Maybe, but... I'm still tired.
HL: My child, the time will come when this will be a distant memory.
Begin now, and every day will get easier.

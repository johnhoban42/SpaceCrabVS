IJ: BMaFAd; I, Inianda Jeff, have been assigned an important mission!
BUFOe; ...But who has time to remember trivialities like that?
BOFQb; I'm in this for the adventure! The path to riches awaits!

BKFAi; Your work will then guide me to a fruitful lead in my adventure!

AL: BBFRb; You could have just asked for work, if you wanted it.
BIFOj; No need to bring fists into an office space.
IJ: BAFOb; Nonsense, fighting gets the blood flowing! Not just in the body, but the brain, too.
BOFQb; Now, I'll have no trouble convincing you to give me a lead!
AL: BBFUa; ...
BAFWa; Well, most of my work is administrative. You're not touching that stuff.
BMFJd; I recently received a call from Hawaiian Crab, though.
BAFGd; A bit of a meteor emergency in the Rotation Station outskirts.
BIFJd; Can you check it out?
IJ: BMFJb; Meteor emergency? A perfect target for this wandering adventurer's journey!
IJ: BAFOc; Adios!

AL: BBFRa; Perfect. That gives me more time to read my legal documents.
BBFHa; ...
BAFOc; A wonderful afternoon awaits me!

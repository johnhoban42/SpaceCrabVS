IJ: I, Inianda Jeff, have been assigned an important mission!

Your work will then guide me to a fruitful lead in my adventure.

AL: You could have just asked for work, if you wanted it.

IJ: Meteor emergency? A perfect target for this wandering adventurer's journey!
IJ: Adios!

AL: Perfect. That gives me more time to read my legal documents.

A wonderful afternoon awaits me!

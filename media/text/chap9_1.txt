TP: So your training is going well?
Really?? You spun around for 11 hours straight? That's great!!
I can't wait to hear more! I need to hop off the call though. I'm at the training site.
Keep it up!

Alright, with the planetary marathon coming up soon, it's time to officially start my training plan!
The instructions said to start with a warmup of 50 meteor dodges.
And it looks like... I'm right in time for the forecasted meteor shower!
Let the storm commence!
GAMEPLAY: Dodge 50 meteors in classic mode.
TP: 50 meteors dodged, all done!
TP: Next up...
??: Hello? Anyone out there?
TP: ...a slight detour!

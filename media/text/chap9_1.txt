TP: So, your training is going well?
...
Really? You spun around for 11 hours straight? Good going.
Keep me up to date about any of your future GAINS.
I need to hop off the call now, though. I'm at the training site.
Keep it up!

Alright! With the planetary marathon coming up soon,
it's time to officially start my training plan.
The instructions said to start with a warmup of 50 meteor dodges.
And it looks like... I'm right in time for the forecasted meteor shower!
Let the storm commence!

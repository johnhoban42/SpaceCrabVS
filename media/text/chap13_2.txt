Who should I ask to prom?!
There are soooo many hunks out there - I love a guy who can dodge a meteor.
Those kinds of super duper smart guys are TOTALLY my type!
Especially senpai Crabacus... just thinking of him makes me swoon.
CB: You don't need to call me senpai anymore, Cranime.
Remember? I graduated last year.
CN: S-SENPAI?? What are YOU doing here?
CB: Well, I had to swing by the school to borrow some textbooks.
For as big as the Star Seekers are, many of them don't have a proper education...
What's up with you?
CN: (This must be fate!!)
Senpai, I have a request...
P-please go with me to prom!
CB: Hmm? There's a prom?
I don't remember there being one last year...
CN: Me neither! It must be new!
But, if this is the first one...
There's no one I'd rather go with than you!
CB: Ah, oh geez... I'm flattered.
But wouldn't you rather go with someone younger? Someone more your type?
CN: But you ARE my type!! Let me show you my passion through battle!

CB: Ugh... too much passion.
CB: Your youth is too much for me.
CN: But senpai, you're only one year older than me!
CB: I have to go. Need to ice my bruises...

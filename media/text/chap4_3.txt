TC: BAFDd; All right, I'm ready! What's the next step?
TP: BMFJ; Knock me down.
TC: BSFEa; Wait, huh? I can't do that!
BAFEe; I can barely stay upright myself, much less knock someone else over!
TP: BUFTn; Relax, big wood!
BPFOd; Strength isn't JUST about raw power. It's about how you use it, too!

BMFJc; Play to your strengths, and see if you can knock me down three times.
TC: BWFJd; Alright, I'll give it a shot...

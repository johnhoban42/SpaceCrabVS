TC: All right, I'm ready! What's the next step?
TP: Knock me down.
TC: Wait, huh? I can't do that!
I can barely stay upright myself, much less knock someone else over!
TP: Relax, big wood!
Strength isn't JUST about raw power. It's about how you use it, too!
You've been spinning all your life, so put that to use!
Play to your strengths, and see if you can knock me down 3 times.
Alright, I'll give it a shot...

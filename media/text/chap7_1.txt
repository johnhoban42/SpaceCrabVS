??: Taxi! Taxi!
TX: That's me- Taxi Crab. What can I do for ya?
HC: Take me to the Garra Bonito, please! I'm heading out for vacation.
TX: Ah, Hawaiian Crab! Excellent choice.
That's a pretty fancy resort, thinking 'bout it. Treating yourself?
HC: Oh yes. Work has been a real stress recently.
Now that I finished my big project, I can take some time off!
TX: Oh, what's that you do for work?
HC: Dodge meteors.
TX: Oh.
And, uh, the big project?
HC: A big meteor.
TX: You know, I was never a fan of meteor dodging, but I've gotten hooked recently.
Mind doing a bit of overtime, with me?
HC: Of course not! When it's with another crab, there's no stress at all.

TX: Hey, guy. Wake up.
HC: Huh? Whuh happened?
TX: We fought and you passed out.
Got you to your destination, though.
HC: Wow, the Garra Bonito! Thank you so much!
That trip felt like it took no time at all. Five Stars!
I should pass out more often!

TX: Hey, that's a better rating than most of my rides.
Maybe I should start assaulting my customers more often...

TX: BSFA; That's me- Taxi Crab. What can I do for ya?
HC: BAFAg; Take me to the Garra Bonito, please! I'm heading out for vacation.
TX: BKFJc; Ah, Hawaiian Crab! Excellent choice.
BAFGd; That's a pretty fancy resort, thinking 'bout it. Treating yourself?
HC: BSFI; Oh yes. Work has been a real stress recently.
BIFTu; Now that I finished my big project, I can take some time off!
TX: BAFJd; Oh, what's that you do for work?
HC: BBFJa; Dodge meteors.
TX: BAFU; Oh.
BAFWa; And, uh, the big project?
HC: BBFJ; A big meteor.
TX: BKFA; You know, I was never a fan of meteor dodging, but I've gotten hooked recently.
BSFJd; Mind doing a bit of overtime, with me?
HC: BCFAh; Of course not! When it's with another crab, there's no stress at all.

CN: BSFAh; Wow, you must be super rich and popular to get to go on vacation!
BVFS; Think you'll have room on your trip for a cutie like me?

HC: BUFRb; No, Cranime. I won't. I can barely afford vacations as is!
BMFEa; That's why I need this Star Seekers gig in the first place.
RC: BWFJd; Wanted to zoom in on that detail - you think this is a gig?
BAFOb; Buddy, you don't get PAID to party like this!
BMFAh; The Star Seekers are for your enjoyment, positivity, and mental wellbeing.
HC: BUFWa; I hardly believe that.
BDFF; Who would leave out so many flyers for something as time-wasting as a party?
BMFOe; Just because all these idiots are doing labor for free, doesn't mean I'm one of them.
RC: BBFWa; Dude. I won't lie. Your vibes are harsh.
BKFO; Time to show you how some positive energy can turn your day around!

HC: BBFJ; I wasn't kidding about getting paid, though.
BAFJa; Think that'll happen? If not, I'll have to dip. My time is pretty valuable.
RC: BIFJd; You can take that up with the big guy, Space Crab.

KC: BF; Well well, what a pleasant discovery that I've stumbled upon. 
CH: BF; Wow! K-King Crab, HERE?? I'm in the presence of Royalty...
CK: BF; (I don't know about that... he's just here to pick up his order.)
KC: BF; You! Boy with the puppets! You're destined for grand things, I can tell.
BF; That's why I want YOU to have a spot on my royal court...
CH: BF; (I must be dreaming! A golden ticket, dropped right in my lap!)
KC: BF; As the royal JESTER! Hohoho!
CK: BF; Puppet Crab, surely you won't take this insulting offer?
BF; There are no shortcuts to the top, you know.
CH: BF; Are you crazy? This is exactly what I've been hoping for!
BF; It's way closer to my goals than what I'm doing here.
BF; King Crab, I'm in! You've got a new jester!
BF; (This is my chance to skip right to the top! World domination is coming into reach!)

KC: Well well, what a pleasant discovery that I've stumbled upon. 
CH: Wow! K-King Crab, HERE?? I'm in the presence of Royalty...
CK: (I don't know about that... he's just here to pick up his order.)
KC: You! Boy with the puppets! You're destined for grand things, I can tell.
That's why I want YOU to have a spot on my royal court...
CH: (I must be dreaming! A golden ticket, dropped right in my lap!)
KC: As the royal JESTER! Hohoho!
CK: Puppet Crab, surely you won't take this insulting offer?
There are no shortcuts to the top, you know.
CH: Are you crazy? This is exactly what I've been hoping for!
It's way closer to my goals than what I'm doing here.
King Crab, I'm in! You've got a new jester!
(This is my chance to skip right to the top! World domination is coming into reach!)

CN: Hey hey! Crabby Cakes!
CA: Ahh, welcome, Cranime, welcome!
What can I get for my favorite customer?
CN: The usual! A box of tasty donuts and sweets!
Oh! And a parfait, too!
CA: Well, if you want all that, you'll have to wait a bit.
I got ANOTHER rush order for ANOTHER 200 cakes!
CN: EEEHHHH?! Really?!
CA: I'm working double overtime as it is!
At least I have help from my plucky assisstant.
CC: ... (laying on the floor, conked out)
CN: Wow, this must be a SUPER huge event!
What's it all for? Tell me! TELL ME!
CA: Ohhh no. The last time I spilled the beans, I had to get my hands dirty.
And with dirty hands, one cannot bake a cake!
CN: :(
CA: B-but for my favorite customer, maybe we can battle for the info?
CN: YAY! ^w^

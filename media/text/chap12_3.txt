CA: Al Legal said that the ingredient delivery would be done by a young child...
My, the youth of today sure set my heart a-flutter! Such wonder in their eyes.
Oh! Is that the child now? What speedy service!
FC: Hello sir! I was told these ingredients go to a big pink guy.
CA: Yes, guilty as charged! I'm ready for my baking supplies.
FC: Just let me get your signature and you'll be all set!
What do you need this many eggs for, anyways?
CA: I'm filling a cake order for the new premiere exploration group, the Star Seekers.
Or so I'm told that they're the premiere group, anyways.

CA: Hmm?
FC: The Star Seekers are my sworn enemies. I can't bring myself to help them in any way.
Even if it's something as small as... delivering ingredients for their cakes!

FC: NO! If you want to sign the delivery slip, you'll have to pry it from my claws!

So many obsessives!
I'm just trying to bake, for goodness sake.
But even if I have the ingredients, I still need to bake all of the cakes so quickly.
...Oh no...
I won't have to ask HIM for help, will I?
Of course I will! I am a professional!
No amount of setbacks will keep me away from the finish line!

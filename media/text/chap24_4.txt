KC: Say, it really is quite boring here without comic relief.
My knight, would you be able to fill the role?
KN: Well, my son always says I'm too stiff, a little bit humorless...

CH: You all laughed at me before, but it's my turn to do the laughing now! HA!
KC: Correction - no one was laughing at you. That's why I locked you away.
Speaking of, shouldn't you still be down in the dungeon?
KN: Stay back! This child no longer acts from a place of innocence.
CH: I'm flattered. Before, you paid no attention to me, and now I'm the dangerous focal point.
How about we go and take this crab down, my no-longer-felt beasts?
And King Crab? He's next. After that? We'll rule the universe!
KN: Never!

CK: Oh my, away for only three hours, and already picking up so much uncouth vocabulary.

CH: That's not my na- wait, what did you call me?
CK: Chimaera Crab, I know you have big aspirations. But for now? You're still a little crab.
Learn the value of hard work, don't take any shortcuts!
The future will come when it's ready for you.
CH: Aww... Crab Cake...

Okay! Let's get back to baking! This hard work won't learn the value of itself!
I've got lots of time to get back to the top, so let's do it properly!
(Or, I'll just get in touch with Devil Crab again... heh heh!)

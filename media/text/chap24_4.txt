KC: BBFUa; Hmm, it really is quite boring here without comic relief.
BMFWa; My knight, would you be able to fill the role?
KN: BDFF; Well, my son always says I'm too stiff, a little bit humorless...
BAFa; So probably not, no.

CH: B0AFDb; You all laughed at me before, but it's my turn to do the laughing now! HA!
KC: BAFDa; Correction - no one was laughing at you. That's why I locked you away.
BVFDe; Speaking of, shouldn't you still be down in the dungeon?
KN: BSFD; Stay back! This child no longer acts from a place of innocence.
CH: B0MFB; I'm flattered. Before, you paid no attention to me, and now I'm the dangerous focal point.
B0WFAa; How about we go and take this crab down, my no-longer-felt beasts?
B0VFB; And King Crab? He's next. After that? We'll rule the universe!
KN: BZFB; Never!

CK: BBFOj; Oh my, away for a few hours, and already picking up so much uncouth vocabulary.
BMFEa; Chimaera Crab, this isn't you. What happened to my sweet little baker's boy?
CH: BVFJd; That's not my na- wait, what did you call me?
CK: BSFEb; Chimaera Crab, I know you have big aspirations. But for now? You're still a little crab.
BUFO; Learn the value of hard work, don't take any shortcuts!
BAFAa; The future will come when it's ready for you.
CH: BBFEb; Aww... Crab Cake...

BVFA; Okay! Let's get back to baking! This hard work won't learn the value of itself!
BMFJb; I've got lots of time to get back to the top, so let's do it properly!

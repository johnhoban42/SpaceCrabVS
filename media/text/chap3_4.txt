SC: Oh! I haven't told Space Ned any of the news since my ship crashed.

se phone
Hey, Ned. You heard the news, right? (on the phone, for the rest of the scene)
That's right, forget my ship- lets put all of our energy into...
1F: Space Crab! Wow, it's really you!!
Oh, wow, I'm feeling a little starstruck.
I almost forget what I came here to talk about...
SC: The Star Seekers!
1F: Yes! That's exactly it!!
SC: Recruitment is the first step.
So, I've been trying to scout potential members...
1F: (No. Way. Is he about to scout ME?!)
(This is, like, my top fantasy.)

SC: ...and I can't think of ANYONE else!
1F: ...huh?
SC: There are no other crabs I can think of who would be a good fit.
1F: But Space Crab... I'm right here! I'm ready. I'm willing!
SC: In fact, I would ask ANY crab I saw to join. 
1F: Am I invisible to you??
SC: Maybe we'll just have to shut the whole thing down.

1F: NO! What about the #SpaceCrab3 dream?!
I don't know what game you're playing, Space Crab, but I'll make you notice me NO MATTER WHAT!!

SC: What's that, Ned? Sorry, I'm getting some call interference.
SC: I'll head to an area with less, uh, meteors.

1F: Wait... you were on the phone this WHOLE TIME?
Am I so insignificant, that a PHONE is more important than me?
Even after all that effort, I couldn't get him to notice me.
He was my only focus for so much of my life... what else do I have?
...
??: Well, child, they do say to never meet your heroes.
1F: I can't believe it's actually true.
CC: Well, if it's any consolation...
I'd love to have you on board with my group.
No seeking of stars is in the agenda...
But I'll make sure no crab in the galaxy could ever ignore you again.
1F: That would be nice.
CC: No more fretting, Fan of Crabs! Let's make the galaxy a Fan of You!

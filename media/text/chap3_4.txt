SC: BAFA; Oh! I haven't told Space Ned any of the news since my ship crashed.

BEFGa; Hey, Ned. You heard the news, right?
BGFAc; That's right, forget my ship- let's put all of our energy into...
1F: BAFSb; Space Crab! Wow, it's really you!!
BTFSa; Oh, wow, I'm feeling a little starstruck.
BTFW; I almost forgot what I came here to talk about...
SC: BEFQ; The Star Seekers!
1F: BVFSa; Yes! That's exactly it!!
SC: BEFJe; Recruitment is the first step.
BEFJd; So far, I've been trying to scout potential members...
1F: BHFPa; (No. Way. Is he about to scout ME?!)
BTFSd; (This is, like, my top fantasy.)

SC: BGFAi; ...and I can't think of ANYONE else who I want to join!
1F: BBFJ; ...huh?
SC: BGFAg; There are no other crabs I can think of who would be a good fit.
1F: BMFJe; But Space Crab... I'm right here! I'm ready. I'm willing!
SC: BEFAf; In fact, I would probably ask ANY crab I saw to join. 
1F: BBFEe; Am I invisible to you??
SC: BGFE; Maybe we'll just have to shut the whole thing down...

1F: BSFMd; NO! What about the #SpaceCrab3 dream?!

BPFDe; NO MATTER WHAT!!

1F: BBFEe; Wait... you were on the phone this WHOLE TIME?
BBFE; Am I so insignificant, that a PHONE CALL is more important than me?
BQFYe; Even after all that effort, I couldn't get him to notice me.
BQFYh; He was my only focus for so much of my life... what else do I have?
...
??: Well, child, they do say to never meet your heroes.
1F: BQFYg; I can't believe it's actually true.
CC: BBFH; Well, if it's any consolation...
BLFJc; I'd love to have you on board with my group.
BAFHa; No seeking of stars is in the agenda...
BMFDc; But I'll make sure no crab in the galaxy could ever ignore you again.
1F: BBFEb; That would be nice.
CC: BOFKd; No more fretting, Fan of Crabs! Let's make the galaxy a Fan of You!

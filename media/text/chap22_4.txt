SC: BPFB; Ladder Wizard! You've got the portal spell ready?
LW: BWFD1b; Ready to cast at your go-ahead!
SC: BOFDd; Chrono Crab! Have enough time power to reach into the future?
CC: BDFQ; You must doubt me! I'm overflowing with enthusiasm and capability!
SC: BPFDc; Ninja Crab! Do you-
SC: BHFPa; Wait, what are you DOING here?
NC: BVFB; A warning, Space Crab.
BAFNe; Time is dangerous - altering history has consequences we can't imagine.
CC: BSFKd; Don't listen to him, Crab of Space - with this spell, time will be yours to malleate!
SC: BBFV; Ninja Crab...
BVFEb; I have to do this. For the sake of the Star Seekers. For the sake of all of us.
NC: BBFTq; ...Very well.

*CRAB-SPLOSION*
LW: BSFMd; *cough, cough*
CC: BJFXd; How exhilarating! Truly tumultuous!
NC: BVFB; Is everyone all right!?
SC: BQFYc; It looks like it. But where's the portal?
NC: BBFKc; No portal... but it looks like we have a visitor.
FC: BZFV; ...
SC: BSFJd; Who... are you?

FC: BAFFd; I am... Space Crab.
SC: BWFEa; That's impossible! Unless...!
CC: BSFSc; My my, you must be my Starlight Rival... from the FUTURE!
FC: BBFVa; Starlight Rival? I haven't heard that in a long time.
BMFGd; Reminds me of back then... I started an expedition team. I think they were called... the Star Seers.
LW: BAFJ1b; Wow, Space Crab, you started ANOTHER team after the Star Seekers?
FC: BAFJd; Star Seekers- that's what it was. My memory is hazy - this was all so long ago.
SC: BVFDd; Long ago? What happened?? I need to know!
FC: BWFEb; You remind me of myself- I used to have that fierce energy. That all changed, though.
BBFE; I had just formed the Star Seekers. But my fear for the future got the better of me.
BMFEa; I asked my two great friends- Ladder Wally and Chronos Crab, to help me see the future.
BNFEa; But a figment of my future life visited, instead- he warned me that the Star Seekers would crumble.
BDFEb; I didn't believe him, of course. So I challenged him to a battle - big mistake.
BUFH; My future self beat me so badly. I lost control of myself, obsessed with the future, and everyone fled. 
BBFV; Every Star Seeker, who I worked so hard to build trust with- became scared of me, and disappeared.
BBFH; Since then, I've lived a life of isolation. I'll end my life like I started it. Alone.

SC: BIFMd; NO! That can't be my fate! I REFUSE!!
FC: BMFJd; Your fate? What do you mean? Say, you kind of look like-

BAFDe; !
BOFBa; So, it was YOU who started all of this!
BMFDd; You ruined our lives! Doomed us to push everyone away, because of your future obsession!
SC: BSFKc; N-no I didn't!? Did I?
FC: BVFD; And now I finally get my chance for revenge, a one-on-one pummeling.
BVFDe; Two lonely souls, finally given a chance for fleeting connection- even if it's with ourselves!
SC: BPFDa; Not so fast! I'm not alone anymore.
BMFD; The crabs I've met- I won't forget their stories, like you have.

BAFDb; I'll fight for the connections, I'll fight for the Star Seekers, I'll-

SC: BPFOh; I'll keep on fighting! Whatever it takes to change my fate!
FC: BQFYi; Stop- *cough* -you've bested me.
BQFY; How strange, that the events that transpired here, contradict my memory.
BQFYa; Were you truly strong enough to change the future?
BQFYd; Time will tell.

SC: BHFPa; !
SC: BAFEe; What!? Where did he go?!
NC: BIFC; Your timeline has altered. That 'Future Crab' is no longer of this reality.
BWFA; How he eventually materializes- that's up to you, Space Crab.
SC: BBFVa; ...

BMFDd; Then I guess all we can really do is move forward, then. Mistakes and all.
BDFH; I won't be able to see my future and live to experience it, too. That's clear to me now.
BVFDb; All we can do is work towards our dreams, and do what we can to keep them alive!
NC: BAFO; Well put. Onwards to our legacy!
LW: BVFJ1b; You said it. I'll be around for the journey, too!
KC: BMFOa; And of course, I'll be the one leading said journey. OHOHO!
CK: BUFJb; We'll be needing some sweets for the trip, no? Allow me to contribute.
HC: BBFKi; Wait, how long is this trip again? I'll check that I have the vacation time...
TX: BDFKc; Hold on! My taxi can't fit all of you! Don't make the trip too long.
TP: BKFO; No worries, dude! We'll just jog there, it'll make for a good warmup.
CB: BDFI; C'mon, Team Player, you know me- I'm not the athletic type.
RC: BKFAh; Play some party music, that'll get everyone in the mood to move!
SB: BCFBd; Woof!
MC: BVFJe; Are you all NUTS?! I'm NOT walking the whole time.
KN: BUFAe; Some discipline would do you well, boy. You're walking.
AL: BZFWa; Also, I checked your contract. We have no obligation to provide transportation.
TC: BAFAg; I'm looking forward to the journey. Let's put our skills to the test!
IJ: BNFDb; Well put, Woody! Let's set our sights on adventure.
RL: BMFA; Hey, can someone help me carry my gear? We gotta have some tunes for the road.
HL: BAFTn; Find the inner strength to carry your own necessities. Wimp.
1F: BSFS; Wow, this is way more crabs than the Star Destroyers. It'll take a long time to get everything packed...
CN: BWFSd; Heeeyy, maybe that kawaii clock looking guy can speed things up for us! ^_^
CC: BAFL; No can do, eyedoll. Casting that spell knocked me clean out of juice!
BMFKh; We've got a long time to wait before we make another play THAT big.
SC: BIFAa; Good thing that we've got all the time we need!
BVFT; The story of the Star Seekers - and the rest of our lives...
BOFO; It starts NOW!

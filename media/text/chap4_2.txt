TC: Team Player would be the best crab to ask for help...
But he's so popular, he's so busy... I don't want to bother him.
I shouldn't have even come to visit him- I'll just sneak away...
TP: Look here, it's Top Crab! How are you, my wooden guy?
TC: Augh!
Sorry, you startled me. I actually wanted to ask something, if you have the time...
TP: Of course, I'll always make time for a friend!
TC: Well... do you know how to get stronger?
I was invited into a group of elite crabs, but I shouldn't be there with my current skills!
TP: I'm glad you came my way!
Starting is the first step to a better self.
Plus, training is my specialty.
We'll work out a routine plan which you can start after a rest day.
Then, check back in with me after 2 weeks to see how you're feeling.
TC: B-but I want to start now!
TP: Oh, eager, are you?
Then let's start with the warm up - get out there and dodge at least 20 meteors!
TC: Yes! Will do!

TC: Whew, that was tough! I might need to warm up to that in the future.
TP: Silly guy, that WAS the warm up!
Now, follow me, so we can start your routine for the day.

TC: Oh geez...
Well, if this is what it takes to get stronger, then I'll do it.

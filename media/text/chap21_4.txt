SC: It's over, Chrono Crab! Crabyss Knight told me everything.
CC: That 'knight' in shining armor, who can barely finish a sentence without breaking into monologue?
SC: Yeah, him. He said that you're trying to harness the evil powers of space, for no reason besides greed!
CC: And what of it, rival? Afraid that you'll lose our eternal battle?
SC: I don't CARE about the rivalry anymore! Just don't destroy the universe!

CC: You- you WHAT?!

Don't care about the rivalry? For what other purpose are we to do this?!
SC: Listen. I finally found something to fight for, besides myself.
The partners I've made along the way - they trust me to guide them to a brighter future.
You're not going to take that away with your stupid schemes!
CC: Listen here! If you want to stop me, then you WILL take the mantle of my Rival!
My terms and conditions are the conditions to be termed!
SC: Then I guess there's no other choice! Fight me head on, Starlight Rival!

CC: This is the full might of your Star Seekers?
A crab, his spell boy, and a rickety old suit of armor?
HA! How small! Only three of you! HA!
SC: Not even close, Chrono Crab.
We've got a whole legion working together - we're back and better than ever!
1F: (Hey, boss, he isn't lying.)
(I don't think you can take on ALL of the Star Seekers.)
CC: (Excellent fact verification. Not to worry, I will make sure that the Star Destroyers prosper!)
1F: (Wait, why are we called that, again?)

CC: Crab of Space! Based on your information, we may be unbalanced in numbers.
Favoring myself, of course. But I have a solution!
Allow me, and my accomplices, to join your ranks!
SC: You'll - what? Huh? 
CC: This way, our rivalry will no longer be reliant on numbers! Only our fighting strength and passion prevail.
SC: Uh, yeah, I guess that makes sense? Will you stop trying to take over the galaxy?
CC: Of course, you whelk. If it doesn't help me to defeat my Starlight Rival, what use is there in doing?
SC: I... can buy that for now. Maybe. Well, welcome to the Star Seekers.
CC: My pleasure!
(Until we VS again, my Starlight Rival!)

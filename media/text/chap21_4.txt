SC: BAFDe; It's over, Chrono Crab! Crabyss Knight told me everything.
CC: BWFOe; That 'knight' in shining armor, who can barely finish a sentence without breaking into monologue?
SC: BVFBa; Yeah, him. He said that you're trying to harness the evil powers of space, for no reason besides greed!
CC: BIFKd; And what of it, rival? Afraid that you'll lose our eternal battle?
SC: BAFEe; I don't CARE about the rivalry anymore! Just don't destroy the universe!

CC: BHFPa; You- you WHAT?!

BNFKc; Don't care about the rivalry? For what other purpose are we to do this?!
SC: BMFDa; Listen. I finally found something to fight for, besides myself.
BDFEa; The partners I've made along the way - they trust me to guide them to a brighter future.
BPFBa; You're not going to take that away with your stupid schemes!
CC: BMFDa; Listen here! If you want to stop me, then you WILL take the mantle of my Rival!
BMFKh; My terms and conditions are the conditions to be termed!
SC: BPFDe; Then... I guess there's no other choice! Fight me head on, Starlight Rival!
CC: BPFB; With pleasure!

CC: BVFKd; This is the full might of your Star Seekers?
BUFKe; A whelk, his spell boy, and a rickety old suit of armor?
BAFOc; HA! How small! Only three of you! HA!
SC: BQFYd; Not even close, Chrono Crab.
BPFQ; We've got a whole legion working together - we're back and better than ever!
1F: BTFNe; (Hey, boss, he isn't lying.)
BTFN; (I don't think you can take on ALL of the Star Seekers.)
CC: BTFNe; (Excellent fact verification. Not to worry, I will make sure that the Star Destroyers prosper!)
1F: BBFF; (Wait, why are we called that, again?)

CC: BTFNg; (Think, THINK! There must be a way to best him... SOMEHOW...)
BIFKf; !
BUFOa; Crab of Space! Based on your information, we may be unbalanced in numbers.
BMFKg; Favoring myself, of course. But, I have a solution!
BOFQ; Allow me, and my accomplices... to join your ranks!
SC: BBFKj; You'll - what? Huh? 
CC: BVFQa; This way, our rivalry will no longer be reliant on numbers! Only strength and passion will prevail.
SC: BAFCe; Uh, yeah, I guess that makes sense... Will you stop trying to take over the galaxy?
CC: BUFOe; Of course, you whelk. If it doesn't help me to defeat my Starlight Rival, what use is there in doing?
SC: BAFJd; I... can buy that for now. Maybe. Well, welcome to the Star Seekers.
CC: BAFOc; My pleasure!

BSFKd; (And as we lie in waiting, the final piece of my dominance is set to bloom shortly...)
BWFK; (My pleasure, indeed!)

AL: BAFAe; Ah, so you must be Mad Crab.
MC: BUFJd; Yeah, that's me. Who's asking?
AL: BMFAa; Al Legal, galactic lawyer.
BCFFb; Based on what Space Crab said, you're quite a curious case.
MC: BAFJe; A 'curious case'? What's THAT supposed to mean?!
AL: BAFJa; Ah, well, just that the things you did for the Star Seekers have interesting legal ramifications.
MC: BSFJd; Legal ramifications?! I HATE losers who hide behind the law!
AL: BVFIa; Well, no hiding will be done today.
BZFA; Your actions have been in plain sight, with multiple witnesses.
BAFJa; While you WERE charged with breaking, entering, and assault...
MC: BZFJe; Don't try to bust me for that! I'LL BUST YOU!

AL: BUFD; You didn't. Let me. Finish.

AL: BZFJa; While you WERE charged with breaking and entering, the proper permits for the organization never existed.
BBFJd; So, that charge is cleared.
BAFWa; Your assault charges were dropped, as well.
BDFH; Actually, King Crab never dropped his case, but he never pays for my services - so let's forget about him.
BMFJa; Additionally, Space Crab wants to recognize your efforts for 'totally knocking sense back into him'.
BAFWa; As a result, you've been appointed Commander of the Star Seekers. Congratulations.
MC: BBFJ; ...
MC: BAFJe; It's about time.

Ah, so you must be Mad Crab.
MC: Yeah, that's me. Who's asking?
AL: Al Legal, galactic lawyer.
Based on what Space Crab said, you're quite a curious case.
MC: A 'curious case'? What's THAT supposed to mean?!
AL: Ah, well, just that the things you did for the Star Seekers have interesting legal ramifications.
MC: Legal ramifications?! I HATE losers who hide behind the law!
AL: Well, no hiding will be done today.
Your actions have been in plain sight, with multiple witnesses.
While you were charged with breaking, entering, and assault...
MC: Don't try to bust me for that! I'LL BUST YOU!

AL: You didn't. Let me. Finish.
MC: ...
AL: While you were charged with breaking and entering, the proper permits for the organization never existed.
So, that charge is cleared.
Your assault charges were dropped, as well.
Actually, King Crab never dropped his case, but he never pays for my services - so let's forget about him.
Additionally, Space Crab wants to recognize your efforts in, as he puts it, 'totally knocking my senses in'.
As a result, you've been appointed Commander of the Star Seekers. Congratulations.
MC: ...
MC: It's about time.

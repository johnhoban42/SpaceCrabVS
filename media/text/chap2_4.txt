LW: BOFDa; Who's there? I've got a re-visibility spell at the ready!
NC: BAFA; Not invisible. Only quiet.
BAFAc; I will not be deceptive. Just quick.
BIFAe; Stop what you are doing. Now.
LW: BDFIa; I was only talking on the phone.
BCFA1d; If you don't have one, I'd be happy to learn a duplication spell and-
NC: BAFB; You know what I mean.
BAFAe; Put an end to the Star Seekers.
LW: BMFC1d; Huh? What are you saying??
NC: BAFAe; I am not here to judge what is right or wrong.
BIFA; Only to execute what is necessary for the future to survive.
BAFAe; And the Star Seekers, as you are creating it, is incompatible with my mission.
BIFB; So I'll say it again. Put an end to the Star Seekers.
LW: BMFJ1; ...
BAFA1d; ...No. I won't.
BDFB1; I figured that there would be challenges.

NC: BAFA; I hear your words.

NC: BAFA; We must wait, until the full Space Crab VS game releases.
LW: BKFA1d; Oh, I heard about that! More than 20 crabs will be in the full game, apparently.
BMFJ1a; They all probably have their own stories to tell, right?
BLFJ1b; That's perfect! I hope we can get them ALL to join the Star Seekers.
NC: BIFAc; You must understand that that is a grave mistake.
BAFA; There is no reason to create the Star Seekers - not when local multiplayer battles exist.
Between that, and multiple single player arcade modes, players will be busy enough as is.
LW: BPFB1; We'll see when then game comes out. The Star Seekers will LIVE!
NC: BAFAc; No.

LW: BPFS1; Wait!
BAFU1; I can't believe I let him get the last word in...
BPFD1a; Hey! You! The one reading my words!
BKFB1; Make sure to wishlist Space Crab VS on Steam! The crab dream must live on!
BAFJ1b; Until then, well, see you in a bit!

LW: Who's there? I've got a re-visibility spell at the ready!
NC: Not invisible. Only quiet.
I will not be deceptive. Just quick.
Stop what you are doing. Now.
LW: I was only talking on the phone.
If you don't have one, I'd be happy to learn a duplication spell and-
NC: You know what I mean.
Put an end to the Star Seekers.
LW: Huh? What are you saying??
NC: I am not here to judge what is right or wrong.
Only to execute what is necessary for the future to survive.
And the Star Seekers, as you are creating it, is incompatible with my mission.
So I'll say it again. Put an end to the Star Seekers.
LW: ...
...No. I won't.
I figured that there would be challenges.

But if something is worth doing, it's worth doing all the way.
I'm not even close to finishing my goal- I won't give up until I do!
NC: I hear your words. But I don't approve.

NC: We must wait, until the full Space Crab VS game releases.
LW: Oh, I heard about that! More than 20 crabs will be in the full game, apparently.
They all probably have their stories to tell, right?
That's perfect! I hope we can get them ALL to join the Star Seekers.
NC: You must understand that that is a grave mistake.
There is no reason to create the Star Seekers - not when local multiplayer battles exist.
Between that, and multiple single player arcade modes, players will be busy enough as is.
LW: We'll see when then game comes out. The Star Seekers will LIVE!
NC: No.

LW: Wait!
I can't believe he got the last word in...
Hey! You! The one reading my words!
Make sure to wishlist Space Crab VS on Steam! The crab dream must live on!
Until then, well, see you in a bit!

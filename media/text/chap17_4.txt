HL: And so, we come to the final crab in need of divination.
The catalyst for this ripple of turmoil- can one crab really be so cruel?
SC: I guess that's one way to describe it.
But I learned my lesson. You don't need to worry about me any more.
I'm throwing in the towel. No more Star Seekers.
After all the crabs I hurt, it's the only right thing to do.

HL: Oh dear. Space Crab has turned towards the darkest path imaginable.
Laying out negativity, and then sweeping it under the rug...
If he is to be course corrected, he'll need an awfully big push!
SC: Wait, what do you mean?

HL: You see, Space Crab... if responsibility isn't taken for one's actions, has one truly acted?
SC: That's a point! I want this Star Seeker stuff to disappear.
You really aren't making any sense at all.
HL: If one step isn't far enough, then take another one back.
Think to those crabs who you gave hope - the hope of a community, a sense of belonging.
Is that not what you wanted to create?
SC: I did! We were going to be the best. The biggest.
HL: And there lies the core. Is being the biggest all you were truly after?
SC: Of course not! Stop twisting my words.
HL: There we have it. The truth of Space Crab's desire has blossomed into a beautiful statement.
My work here is done.

You're really confusing.
Though, now I feel...
Ready?
Yeah, ready!
The Star Seekers is something that I want. I know that now.
Not to settle a rivalry - but to reach my own goals.
And not just for me. For all the crabs out there who need a place to belong!
Let's go! The Star Seekers are back in business!!

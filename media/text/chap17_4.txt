HL: BSFTp; And so, we come to the final crab in need of divination.
BUFWy; The catalyst for this ripple of turmoil- can one crab really be so cruel?
SC: BCFHa; I guess that's... one way to describe it.
BSFEb; But I learned my lesson. You don't need to worry about me any more.
BBFTp; I'm throwing in the towel. No more Star Seekers.
BUFH; After all the crabs I hurt, it's the only right thing to do.

HL: BAFWy; Oh dear. Space Crab has turned towards the darkest path imaginable.
BWFTp; Laying out negativity, and then sweeping it under the rug...
BVFWv; If he is to be course corrected, he'll need an awfully big push!
SC: BSFJe; Wait, what do you mean?

HL: BAFTn; You see, Space Crab... if responsibility isn't taken for one's actions, has one truly acted?
SC: BSFMd; That's the point! I want this Star Seeker stuff to disappear.
BBFEa; You really aren't making any sense at all.
HL: BDFJd; If one step isn't far enough, then take another one back.
BMFTp; Think to those crabs whom you gave hope - the hope of a community, a sense of belonging.
BUFDd; Is that not what you wanted to create?
SC: BMFEd; I did! We were going to be the best. The biggest.
HL: BOFDe; And there lies the core. Is being the biggest ALL you were truly after?
SC: BVFDe; Of course not! Stop twisting my words.
HL: BWFTo; There we have it. The truth of Space Crab's desire has blossomed into a beautiful statement.
BAFWv; My work here is done.

BAFRa; You're really confusing.
BMFFd; Though, now I feel... Ready?
BIFA; Yeah, ready!
BVFJa; The Star Seekers are something that I want to happen. I know that now.
BBFAb; Not to settle a rivalry - but to reach my own goals.
BMFJb; And not just for me. For all the crabs out there who need a place to belong!
BPFOd; Let's go! The Star Seekers are back in business!!

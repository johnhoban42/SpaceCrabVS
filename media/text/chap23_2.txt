S8: BAFAa; Yo, taxi! I need a lift to Al Legal's pad.
BVFOd; We're taking this song right to the top.
TX: BSFJ; I can take you, if you're fine with ride-share.
S8: BSFDa; Nuh-uh! Do you have any idea how precious my cargo is? This song could change everything!
TX: BSFCe; Pal, there aren't that many choices for transport around here.
BKFJd; Hop in, or you're walkin'.
S8: BBFD; Hmph.
CN: BSFSd; Woooow, you're a real subeko shonen!
BIFJb; Is it hard to skate with such stubby legs?
S8: BDFTn; You know, the law says my legs are too short to skate.
BAFOe; But I don't listen to the law. I'm too cool.
CN: BAFAa; Oh, and you're an aku gaki, too. I like that.
BMFTn; Mind if I... sit a little closer?
TX: BDFWa; Yo, 'rebel'. Mind putting on your seat belt?
S8: BDFM; (Dude, you're harshing my vibe back here! I'm trying to score!)
TX: BQFUa; I'm not putting my foot on the gas until your seatbelt is on.
S8: BVFB; I get it. I'll just prove that I'm a bad enough dude to not need one!

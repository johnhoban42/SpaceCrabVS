We're taking this song right to the top.
TX: I can take you, if you're fine with ride-share.
S8: Nuh-uh! Do you have any idea how precious my cargo is? This song could change everything!

Is it hard to skate with such stubby legs?
S8: You know, the law says my legs are too short to skate.

CN: Oh, and you're an aku gaki, too. I like that.
Mind if I... sit a little closer?
TX: Yo, 'rebel'. Mind putting on your seat belt?
S8: (Dude, you're harshing my vibe back here! I'm trying to score!)
TX: I'm not putting my foot on the gas until your seatbelt is on.
S8: I get it. I'll just prove that I'm a bad enough dude to not need one!

S8: Hey, wait! I won that battle! You should be giving me a ride!
TX: I'm not driving someone who won't wear a seat belt.
Besides, you've got wheels, right? Drive yourself.

Don't they know that I'll be a rock star one day?

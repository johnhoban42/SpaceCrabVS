SB: This has possibly been the most eventful walk of my life.
Typically, I walk the same path, day in and day out.
How lucky I must be to have had so many encounters!
Almost like a trip down memory lane... except, I've never met any of those crabs before.
Nostalgia, deja vu, whatever it's called. How interesting!

SB: Oh my, but you don't look like any crab I've seen before.
Has anyone seen you before?
I suppose one crab might have, quite some time ago...

It looks like my 'playing dead' trick saved my fur once again.
Unlike the other crabs, he didn't seem to have some sort of goofy agenda.
That was a serious fight! My walking route may not be as safe as it once was.
I need some way to protect myself as I explore space.
Perhaps there exists a collective, who seek the stars together, which I could join? 
I'll have to ask around.

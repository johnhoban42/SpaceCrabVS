SB: BEFAg; This has possibly been the most eventful walk of my life.
BEFAd; Typically, I walk the same path, day in and day out.
BAFAg; How lucky I must be to have had so many encounters!
BBFBc; Almost like a trip down memory lane... except, I've never met any of those crabs before.
BBFBe; Nostalgia, deja vu, whatever it's called. How interesting!

BHFFa; It looks like my 'playing dead' trick saved my fur once again.
BHFF; Unlike the other crabs, he didn't seem to have some sort of goofy agenda.
BEFAd; That was a serious fight! My walking route may not be as safe as it once was.
BEFAd; I'll need some way to protect myself as I explore space.
BAFAd; Perhaps there exists a collective, who seek the stars together, which I could join? 
BBFBb; I'll have to ask around.

MC: So, this is where you've been hiding...
The so-called 'Leader of the Star Seekers'...
Come and fight me like a crab!
SC: And why would I need to do that, Mad Crab?
Jealous, that you aren't a part of the galaxy's premiere group?
MC: OF COURSE NOT, you PIPSQUEAK!
Tell me, what does your stupid little group even do?
SC: ...
SC: Well, technically-
MC: Don't even have an answer? Pathetic.
MC: A 'group' that isn't even a group. Hurting crabs that don't deserve it.
It makes me hopping mad!
And you're a PERFECT target for my anger!

SC: Enough, enough!
There's only one way out of this.
Mad Crab, if you're so determined to set things right-
Why not join the Star Seekers and help things out yourself?
MC: ...
MC: You're pathetic. I can't believe I'm wasting my time on a loser like you.
Are all of your other 'Star Seekers' as stupid as you are?
They must be, if they think you make a good leader.
I bet you haven't even told them that you have no plan.
SC: ...
MC: Just take your merry band of idiots somewhere else, and leave me out of it.

SC: Whew...
Thinking about it, I'm glad he's not joining. Too much bad energy!
But like I said, one or two crabs won't make a difference.
Once Ladder Wizard's recruits make it here, we should be the biggest group, no doubt about it.
Chrono Crab doesn't stand a chance.

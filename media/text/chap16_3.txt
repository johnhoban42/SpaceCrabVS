MC: BF; So, this is where you've been hiding...
BF; The so-called 'Leader of the Star Seekers'...
BF; Come and fight me like a crab!
SC: BF; And why would I need to do that, Mad Crab?
BF; Jealous, that you aren't a part of the galaxy's premiere group?
MC: BF; OF COURSE NOT, you PIPSQUEAK!
BF; Tell me, what does your stupid little group even do?
SC: BF; ...
SC: BF; Well, technically-
MC: BF; Don't even have an answer? Pathetic.
MC: BF; A 'group' that isn't even a group. Hurting crabs that don't deserve it.
BF; It makes me hopping mad!
BF; And you're a PERFECT target for my anger!

SC: BF; Enough, enough!
BF; There's only one way out of this.
BF; Mad Crab, if you're so determined to set things right-
BF; Why not join the Star Seekers and help things out yourself?
MC: BF; ...
MC: BBFHa; You're pathetic. I can't believe I'm wasting my time on a loser like you.
BF; Are all of your other 'Star Seekers' as stupid as you are?
BF; They must be, if they think you make a good leader.
BF; I bet you haven't even told them that you have no plan.
SC: BF; ...
MC: BF; Just take your merry band of idiots somewhere else, and leave me out of it.

SC: BF; Whew...
BF; Thinking about it, I'm glad he's not joining. Too much bad energy!
BF; But like I said, one or two crabs won't make a difference.
BF; Once Ladder Wizard's recruits make it here, we should be the biggest group, no doubt about it.
BF; Chrono Crab doesn't stand a chance.

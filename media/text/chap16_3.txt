MC: BVFJa; So, this is where you've been hiding...
BAFU; The so-called 'Leader of the Star Seekers'...
BPFJe; Come and fight me like a crab!
SC: BMFA; And why would I need to do that, Mad Crab?
BAFCb; Jealous, that you aren't a part of the galaxy's premiere group?
MC: BIFOh; OF COURSE NOT, you PIPSQUEAK!
BUFJd; Tell me, what does your stupid little group even do?
SC: BBFJ; ...
SC: BDFJa; Well, technically-
MC: BBFJ; Don't even have an answer? Pathetic.
MC: BSFJd; A 'group' that has no purpose. Hurting crabs that don't deserve it.
BAFOh; It makes me hopping mad!
BZFJe; And you're a PERFECT target for my anger!

SC: BSFMd; Enough, enough!
BIFOj; There's only one way out of this.
BVFJd; Mad Crab, if you're so determined to set things right-
BMFEb; Why not join the Star Seekers and help things out yourself?
MC: BBFJ; ...
MC: BBFHa; You're pathetic. I can't believe I'm wasting my time on a loser like you.
BMFJd; Are all of your other 'Star Seekers' as stupid as you are?
BIFJe; They must be, if they think you make a good leader.
BUFJ; I bet you haven't even told them that you have no plan.
SC: BBFE; ...
MC: BWFHa; Just take your merry band of idiots somewhere else, and leave me out of it.

SC: BBFRb; Whew...
BIFOj; Thinking about it, I'm glad he's not joining. Too much bad energy!
BAFTp; But like I said, one or two crabs won't make a difference.
BOFDb; Once Ladder Wizard's recruits make it here, I'll be the giggest group in the galaxy, no doubt about it.
BVFDc; Chrono Crab doesn't stand a chance.

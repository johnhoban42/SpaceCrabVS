HC: Finally, the resort of my dreams - Garra Bonito, at the Aquarias Stream!
Well, this SHOULD be like a dream-
But I've been so stressed about my reservations not working that I've barely slept!
Once I check in, I can FINALLY start relaxing.
Ah! Here's the check in desk!
AL: Hello sir, welcome to Garra Bonito. Do you have a reservation with us?
We ARE fully booked, so you know, and anyone without a proper reservation will be turned away.
HC: Y-yes! I have everything. Right here.
Booking Number, 09292019.
Confirmation Code, AKRBTKJRH.
Room Code, SLAMJMMDAB.
Or was it SSAM...?
Oh! And Claw Code, SNIP83.
AL: Is that all? There's still one more step, you know.
HC: Huh? But that's everything the booking agency sent me!
AL: A verification battle, of course! Let's see if you battle like the true Hawaiian Crab!

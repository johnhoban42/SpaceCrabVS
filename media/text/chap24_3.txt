CH: BF; Wha... where am I?
BF; Is this King Crab's prison?
BF; Geez, I was so close to the top... only to fall right to the bottom.
HC: BF; Do not worry, my child. Things can still become much worse for you.
CH: BF; W-wow! An actual angel!
BF; If you came to me, then you must be here to bust me out!
HC: BF; Well, my ability to impact the physical world is fairly limited. 
BF; The most I personally can do is provide guidance in the form of encouragement and smiles.
CH: BF; Well, if you can't get me out, then is there anyone like you who can?
HC: BF; Not exactly. Nearly everyone in the astral plane has limited-

DC: BF; So, will you agree to use this ultimate power, for nothing but destruction and villainy?
CH: BF; Uh, YEAH. Of course!
BF; This power... it's how I've always felt on the inside, but couldn't use it!
BF; But wait- what's in this for you?
DC: BF; Your first deal with me is on the house, just 'cause I like you.
BF; Besides, I know you'll be back for more, soon enough.
CH: BF; ...eh, that's fair.

BF; Time to break out of this cage, and show the galaxy my true power!

CH: Wha... where am I?
Is this King Crab's prison?
Geez, I was so close to the top... only to fall right to the bottom.
HC: Do not worry, my child. Things can still become much worse for you.
CH: W-wow! An actual angel!
If you came to me, then you must be here to bust me out!
HC: Well, my ability to impact the physical world is fairly limited. 
The most I personally can do is provide guidance in the form of encouragement and smiles.
CH: Well, if you can't get me out, then is there anyone like you who can?
HC: Not exactly. Nearly everyone in the astral plane has limited-
CH: NEARLY! You said it yourself! So there's someone who can help!

DC: So, you're tryin' to stir some trouble?
CH: Yes, exactly! With my felt monsters, I'll take over the galaxy!

DC: So, will you agree to use this ultimate power, for nothing but destruction and villainy?
CH: Uh, YEAH. Of course!
This power... it's how I've always felt on the inside, but couldn't use it!
But wait- what's in this for you?
DC: Your first deal with me is on the house, just 'cause I like you.
I know you'll be back for more, soon enough.
CH: ...eh, that's fair.

Time to break out of this cage, and show the galaxy my true power!
Starting with that sloth, King Crab.

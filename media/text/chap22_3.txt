SC: Chrono Crab. I was looking for you.
CC: Ah, my Starlight Rival! You caught me at a primary time.
I was just talking with that Space Barc fellow.
It turns out, I can't understand a thing coming out of that beast's mouth!
SC: Chrono Crab, I need your help... with a spell.
CC: ...Do go on.
SC: The Star Seekers- I need to see what comes next.
If I'm going to make a mistake, I have to avoid it! I can't hurt everyone again...
CC: Well, Crab of Space, I can't help you with that. I can only manipulate the time around us.
Unless you'd like me to bring us ALL into... the future?
SC: Nope! Not that. We're keeping this small.
Just a portal into the future - to confirm that things will be alright.
CC: I don't do portals, whelk. I do time.
In fact, I have my own time business to get back to.

What if you casted a double helix spell with Ladder Wizard? 
CC: My, how interesting. How possible. How likely, even.
But you should know, I won't aid for free...
SC: I figured as much. Let's do it, then.

CC: The rematch between Starlight Rivals! Win, and I'll help with your spell!
Lose, and I take control of the Star Seekers, for all of time!
SC: Hold on, I never agreed to-
THE TIME IS NOW!!

SC: Huff... huff... is it... over?
CC: Huff... this time... it appears so...
SC: Not going to... start over again?
CC: You've shown... and proved... your prose... this time...
Besides... if I rewind again...
I won't have the power to aid your double helix spell.
SC: ...Thank you, Chrono Crab.
I'll go get Ladder Wizard. Let's see the future.

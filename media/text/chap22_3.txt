SC: BF; Chrono Crab. I was looking for you.
CC: BF; Ah, my Starlight Rival! You caught me at a primary time.
BF; I was just talking with that Space Barc fellow.
BF; It turns out, I can't understand a thing coming out of that beast's mouth!
SC: BF; Chrono Crab, I need your help... with a spell.
CC: BFKd; ...Do go on.
SC: BF; The Star Seekers- I need to see what comes next.
BF; If I'm going to make a mistake, I have to avoid it! I can't hurt everyone again...
CC: BAFTp; Well, Crab of Space, I can't help you with that. I can only manipulate the time around us.
BNFQa; Unless you'd like me to bring us ALL into... the future?
SC: BF; Nope! Not that. We're keeping this small.
BF; Just a portal into the future - to confirm that things will be alright.
CC: BF; I don't do portals, whelk. I do time.
BF; In fact, I have my own time business to get back to.

What if you casted a double helix spell with Ladder Wizard? 
CC: BF; My, how interesting. How possible. How likely, even.
But you should know, I won't aid for free...
SC: BVFMd; Please! Whatever you I can do for you, I'll do it! It's better than the mental tourture I'm facing now!

BMFOa; Well, you heard it here first! Lawyer boy, are you writing this down?
AL: BZFDe; Drafting it as we speak.
CC: The rematch between Starlight Rivals! Win, and I'll help with your spell!
Lose... and I take control of the Star Seekers, for all of time!
BF; With that power at my disposal, I'll take over the BF; galaxy, and plant my spot...
BF; AS THE SUPERIOR STARLIGHT RIVAL!!
SC: BF; Hold on, I never agreed to-
BVFOh; THE TIME IS NOW!!

SC: BF; Huff... huff... is it... over?
CC: BF; Huff... this time... it appears so...
SC: BF; Not going to... start over again?
CC: BF; You've shown... and proved... your prose... this time...
BF; Besides... if I rewind again...
BF; I won't have the power to aid your double helix spell.
SC: BF; ...Thank you, Chrono Crab.
BF; I'll go get Ladder Wizard. Let's see the future.

SC: BAFDd; Chrono Crab. I was looking for you.
CC: BUFKg; Ah, my Starlight Rival! You caught me at a primary time.
BIFGb; I was just talking with that Space Barc fellow.
BNFOa; It turns out, I can't understand a thing coming out of that beast's mouth!
SC: BCFH; Chrono Crab, I need your help... with a spell.
CC: BVFKd; ...Do go on.
SC: BWFEd; It's the Star Seekers- I need to know what comes next.
BMFV; If I'm going to make a mistake, I have to avoid it! I can't hurt everyone again...
CC: BAFTp; Well, Crab of Space, I can't help you with that. I can only manipulate the time around us.
BNFQa; Unless you'd like me to bring us ALL into... the future?
SC: BSFI; Nope! Not that. We're keeping this small.
BAFJd; Just a portal into the future - to confirm that things will be alright.
CC: BMFDd; I don't do portals, whelk. I do time.
BUFTp; In fact, I have my own time business to get back to.

SC: BOFDa; What if you casted a double helix spell with Ladder Wizard? 
CC: BUFKh; My, how interesting. How possible. How likely, even.
BAFOe; But you should know, I won't aid for free...
SC: BVFMd; Please! Whatever you I can do for you, I'll do it! It's better than the mental tourture I'm facing now!

BMFOa; Well, you heard it here first! Lawyer boy, are you writing this down?
AL: BZFDe; Drafting it as we speak.
CC: BMFOa; The rematch between Starlight Rivals! Win, and I'll help with your spell!
BPFKd; Lose... and I take control of the Star Seekers, for all of time!
BVFB; With that power at my disposal, I'll take over the galaxy, and plant my spot...
BAFL; AS THE ETERNALLY SUPERIOR STARLIGHT RIVAL!!
SC: BSFKc; Hold on, I never agreed to-
CC: BVFOh; THE TIME IS NOW!!

SC: BQFYG; Huff... huff... is it... over?
CC: BQFYf; Huff... this time... it appears so...
SC: Not going to... start over again?
CC: BQFYb; You've shown... and proved... your prose... this time...
BQFY; Besides... if I rewind again...
BQFYa; I won't have the power to aid your double helix spell.
SC: BQFYd; ...Thanks, Chrono Crab.
BVFDb; I'll go get Ladder Wizard. Let's see the future.

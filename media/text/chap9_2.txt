IJ: Ah! A fellow explorer of the cosmos, pleased to meet you!
TP: The cosmos? The only thing I've been exploring is the limits of what my body can achieve!
Though, if an explorer is all the way out here, then there must be something worth seeing.
Did you see anything impressive? Maybe I can make it a new training spot!
IJ: Ah, another eager explorer! Glad to see the spirit of discovery is alive and well.
Normally, I would share my exploits without hesitation. However...
What I discovered was a truly dangerous place.
Strange visions, reflections of the soul, and meteor superstorms. No crab is safe there.
TP: Meteor SUPERSTORMS?? Sounds like the place to take my skills to the next level!
IJ: Alas... I doubt there is a crab alive who's safety could be assured. 
Well... aside from *him*...
TP: Let me prove myself! A one-on-one match, if I win, you tell me where it is.
IJ: Ah, well, who am I to get in the way of an adventurer's spirit? Let's begin!
GAMEPLAY: Vs. Inianda Jeff
IJ: The exploratory spirit is alive and well within you!
As promised, let me point out the constellations which guided me there.
...
TP: Ah, I see now! Thank you sir! If this place is as promising as you say, you'll get a special shoutout in my marathon victor's speech.
*Team Player leaves.*
IJ: I hope that youngster is ready to take on... the *Mirror Dimension*...
...
He'll be fine!

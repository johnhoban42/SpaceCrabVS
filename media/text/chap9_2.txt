IJ: BMFJb; Ah! A fellow explorer of the cosmos, pleased to meet you!
TP: BSFB; The cosmos? The only thing I've been exploring is the limits of what my body can achieve!

IJ: BAFRb; Alas... I doubt there is a crab alive who's safety could be assured. 
BBFHa; Well... aside from *him*...
TP: BMFFb; Let me prove myself! A one-on-one match, and if I win, you tell me where it is.
IJ: BAFGb; Well, who am I to get in the way of an adventurer's spirit? Let's begin!

1F: Wow! You're the Future Space Crab! It's really you!
FC: Oh, and you're the fan.
You know, I really did appreciate your support, over the years...
1F: Wow, in the future, I was still a fan of Space Crab...
WAIT! This is a golden opportunity! I have to ask.
How many more Space Crab games will they make in the future??
FC: Huh, games...
It's been so long since the last Space Crab game, I can hardly remember...
1F: Oh no.
FC: I think, after Space Crab VS, Rondovo Games gave up on making more.
I had disappeared, and with their main character gone, they turned to their other series for sequels.
1F: No!
FC: They made Race Against a Duck 2, 3, 4... who knows how many more.
Later, they turned Notebook Jam into a movie, and then made Notebook Jam: The Movie: The Game.
The fans didn't like that...
Finally, they spent the rest of their lives trying to make another Space game-
Which wasn't very long. They were all hit by meteors shortly after the announcement.

FC: You really shouldn't be taking my memory so seriously.
Because Space Crab bested me in battle, the future is now unwritten.
1F: So... there's a chance that they'll make more Space Crab games?
FC: I think there's a good chance, #1 Fan.
1F: Hot Diggity! That's enough of a thread for me to go off.
Just hearing the POSSIBILITY, that they MIGHT make one- the hype will last me MONTHS!

FC: Whew... that was close.
I didn't want to tell him that HE'D be the one developing Space Crab 3.
I don't think his young heart would be able to take it...

1F: BSFSa; Wow! You're the Future Space Crab! It's really you!
FC: BAFJa; Oh, you're the fan.
BDFEb; You know, I really did appreciate your support, over the years...
1F: BVFS; Wow, so in the future, I was still a fan of Space Crab...
BSFOc; WAIT! This is a golden opportunity! I have to ask.
BOFAd; How many more Space Crab games will they make in the future??
FC: BBFJd; Huh, games...
BMFH; It's been so long since the last Space Crab game, I can hardly remember...

1F: BTFNf; Oh no.

FC: BAFJd; I think, after Space Crab VS, Rondovo Games gave up on making more.
BMFU; I had disappeared, and with their main character gone, they turned to their other series for sequels.
1F: BHFPa; No!
FC: BDFH; They made Race Against a Duck 2, 3, 4... who knows how many more.
BAFGd; Later, they turned Notebook Jam into a movie, then did Notebook Jam: The Movie: The Game.
BBFEa; The fans didn't like that...
BWFJd; Finally, they spent the rest of their lives trying to make another Space game-
BAFEa; Which wasn't very long. They were all hit by meteors shortly after the announcement.

FC: BDFEb; You really shouldn't be taking my memory so seriously.
BAFA; Since Space Crab bested me in battle, the future is now unwritten.
1F: BSFV; So... there's a chance that they'll make more Space Crab games?
FC: BMFAa; I think there's a good chance, #1 Fan.
1F: BVFOf; Hot Diggity! That's enough of a thread for me to go off.
BKFL; Just hearing the POSSIBILITY, that they MIGHT make one- the hype will last me MONTHS!

FC: BBFWa; Whew... that was close.
BDFHa; I didn't want to tell him that HE'D be the one developing Space Crab 3.
BAFEb; I don't think his young heart would be able to take it...

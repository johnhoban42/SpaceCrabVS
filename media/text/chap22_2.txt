SC: BAFU; Ladder Wizard, this feels weird.
LW: BIFA1; I don't get that. What's weird about forming & leading the galaxy's biggest known expedition party?
BSFA1d; We're already discovering so much! Didn't you hear?
BWFJ1b; King Crab was leading Team Player and Top Crab to clear some meteors at the edge of the Milky Way.
BAFGb; On their family bonding trip, Ninja Crab and Cranime found a wormhole at the Rings of Chiron.
BSFQ1b; And Holy Crab's guidance led Rock Lobster & Crab Cake to find new treasure at the Aquarius Stream!
SC: BBFS; Oh, WOW. The crabs sure are eager to explore!
LW: BMFOc; That's what I'm talking about! There's nothing left to worry about.
SC: BIFH; But... what comes 'next'?
LW: BNFFd; Next?
SC: BAFJd; Yeah, next! We barely got the Star Seekers together in the first place.
BDFH; What if I screw things up again?
LW: BIFA1d; You don't need to worry. Just try to live in the now! Things are great 'in the now'!
SC: BVFD; ...I have an idea for a spell. Will you help me?
LW: BBFF; Depends. What's it about?
BAFGb; If it involves ladders, I can't really help you much. It turns out, the name's not at all related-
SC: BAFDd; Time.
LW: BTFN; ...No. No way. Nuh uh!
BSFE1e; I don't touch that stuff. You know I don't.
BBFKc; That means you want me to work with... with...
SC: BVFDb; That's right. I need you and Chrono Crab to make a double helix spell.
BOFB; We're going to look into the future.
LW: BVFMd; Not going to do it! I hate that guy! He almost tried to destroy us all!
SC: BPFB; I'm serious about this, Ladder Wizard. I'll show you my conviction... through battle!
LW: BPFB1a; Don't assume you'll win! I've grown a ton since our first fight!

LW: BBFTr; You won... I guess... I have to help.
SC: BAFEb; I'm not forcing you. But I am asking you, as a fellow Star Seeker.
BMFDc; And as a friend.
LW: BBFF; You seem really serious about this.
BMFH1; I may not trust him, but you seem to, so... I'll help cast the double helix spell.
SC: BAFA; Thanks, Ladder Wizard. I'm glad I can rely on you.
BUFJd; If I can rely on Chrono Crab... we'll have to see.

LW: BAFU; Just... be careful, Space Crab.

SC: Ladder Wizard, this feels weird.
LW: I don't get that. What's weird about forming & leading the galaxy's biggest known expedition party?
We're already discovering so much! Didn't you hear?
King Crab was leading Team Player and Top Crab to go knock away some meteors at the edge of the Milky Way.
On their family bonding trip, Ninja Crab and Cranime found a new wormhole at the Rings of Chiron.
And Holy Crab's guidance led Rock Lobster & Crab Cake to find a new treasure hotspot at the Aquarius Stream!
SC: Oh, WOW. The crabs sure are eager to explore!
LW: That's what I'm talking about! There's nothing left to worry about.
SC: But... what comes 'next'?
LW: Next?
SC: Yeah, next! We barely got the Star Seekers together in the first place.
What if I screw things up again?
LW: You don't need to worry. Just try to live in the now! Things are great 'in the now'!
SC: ...I have an idea for a spell. Will you help me?
LW: Depends. What's it about?
If it involves ladders, I can't really help you much.
It turns out, the name's not at all related-
SC: Time.
LW: ...No. No way. Nuh uh!
I don't touch that stuff. You know I don't.
That means you want me to work with... with...
SC: That's right. I need you and Chrono Crab to make a double helix spell.
We're going to look into the future.
LW: Not going to do it! I hate that guy! He almost tried to destroy us all!
SC: I'm serious about this, Ladder Wizard. I'll show you my conviction... through battle!
LW: Don't think you'll win! I've grown a ton since our first fight!

LW: You won... I guess... I have to help.
SC: I'm not forcing you. But I am asking you, as a fellow Star Seeker.
And as a friend.
LW: You seem really serious about this.
I may not trust him, but you seem to, so... I'll help cast the double helix spell.
SC: Thanks, Ladder Wizard. I'm glad I can rely on you.
If I can rely on Chrono Crab... we'll have to see.

LW: Just... be careful, Space Crab.

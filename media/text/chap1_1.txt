*CRAB-SPLOSION*
SC:BGFU; Come on... pick up...
BEFA; Hey! Space Ned? It's me, Space Crab.
Remember last week, when I let my ship get destroyed by meteors?
BEFIa; It, uh, happened again.
BEFA; Do you think you can tow it? Get the repairs started on it?
BGFU; ...
BEFDe; What?! What do you MEAN your Tow UFO was ALSO destroyed by meteors?
BGFEd; Well, this really sucks.
I'll figure something out, for now.
BEFU; Yep- sounds good, I'll call if I need anything else. Bye.

BBFE; ...
BBFD; Hmph.
RC:BAFA; Whoa, another wayward traveler?
BAFAe; Did you come here too, when you heard that SICK bass drop?
SC: BBFE; Bass drop? That was my ship exploding!
BAFE; My ship that I spent hundreds of coins fixing!
BAFDe; Which I now need to do all over again!!
RC: BCFEb; My man, money shouldn't treated as an obstacle-
BCFA; Only as an enabler for the greater joys in life!
SC: BIFUa; 'My man', your 'pep talk' isn't working.
RC: Well then, how about a quick battle to clear your mind?
SC: BIFC; Wait- battle HERE? Like, with our claws??
RC: No way, man. We'll each take our own planet, yeah? Survival style.
BAFA; We use crashed meteor bits to send over attacks, and extra meteors too.
First one to get hit three times loses. Simple, right?
SC: BAFDb; I get it. Sure, let's blow off some steam!

SC: BAFA; Hey, that was pretty fun! Thanks for showing me how to battle!
RC:BJFXc; N-no problem! (This guy's STRONG!)
BBFW; How did you learn to weave a meteor storm so well?
SC: BIFAb; Well, I have a bit of practice.
BAFAd; I explored TONS of planets to get enough coins to repair my ship.
BCFIa; ...More than once.
RC: BAFW; No way, you're THAT Space Crab?! Every crab out there has heard of you!
BAFO; You must have seen everything in the stars by now! 
SC: BIFAb; Seen everything? Not even close.
BIFA; There are so many wonders out in space- new discoveries, new challanges, new music...
BAFO; I've never had a problem I couldn't solve by seeking out the stars.
RC: BHFPb; ...DUDE.
That was downright poetic, man!
BAFAd; Especially that part at the end- 'seeking out the stars'.
BAFO; You got me more hyped than any party I've been to in a long time!
BAFT; Can I join you, in your 'star seeking'?
SC: BAFS; Huh? Join me?
RC: BAFT; Y'know, I bet if you gave that speech to other crabs, they would totally join too!
BAFL; Everything's better with more crabs! A 24/7 party! The biggest posse in the galaxy!
SC: BCFU; Woah, slow down. The biggest in the galaxy? I'm not sure about that.
BCFI; (That would be pretty cool, though.)
BAFA; A posse, huh? To explore the galaxy together?
BAFAe; I'm a fan of that idea.
BAFDc; Sure, let's do it! Today is the day that the Star Seekers oficially form!
BAFB; Our mission: to explore the cosmos and discover it's infinite wonders.
RC: BAFT; Outrageous, dude! I'll go around and see who wants to join the galaxy's biggest party!

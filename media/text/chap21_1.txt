TP: Here!
1F: Present and ready for duty, sir!
IJ: I may be HERE, yes. But shouldn't we be aiming for the BEYOND here?
CC: No time for that drivel now, Jeffery.
We have to set our sights on the beyond here!
1F: Yeah! The beyond here!!
Where is that? Is it far?
CC: Well, Crab of Fans, our sight is set on the most destructive force in existence.
The Mirror Dimension! Anything entering it is split in two, yes.
No effort, yet double the strength? Temptation, incarnate!
TP: Wow, now that's some power right there!
Where's the training spot?
CC: Myself and our intrepid explorer have been discussing this exact topic.
And we're in agreement! We have no idea where to start.
IJ: That may be true, but I think I have an idea of where to start!
CC: Well then, you whelk, let us start the search process. Precisely now!

CC: Spit it out already, crab!
1F: (Sir, are you sure he knows what he's doing?)
CC: (Now, now, one must be patient with these idiotic types.)
IJ: ...north, again. And for our last step - 
We hop in a Taxi and go to THESE coordinates!
CC: Truly inspirational. Excelling work. Will someone please give Taxi Crab a call?
TP: Already on it, coach!

SC: Well, this is the place. Top Crab said I would his friend here.
Is that him? He's the only crab around, so, probably.
CC: Oh? Who is this small, pathetic crab I see, minutely walking my way?
SC: Minutely? Huh?
CC: Go on, speak what you came here to speak.
My time is minutely precious to me, in a way that YOU wouldn't understand.
SC: (Again with the minutes...)
Hi. I'm Space Crab- Top Crab sent me here.
He said that you might be willing to join my new exploration group- the Star Seekers.
Uhh...
Top of it's class, big plans ahead, and you'll be in on the ground floor. What do you say?
CC: ... (thinking)
...(devious grin)
Actually... my time is better spent elsewhere.
SC: Oh, I see. Can't get everyone, I guess.

CC: Building my OWN Star Seekers!
SC: WHAT?!
CC: No, not just seekers... a Galactic Empire!
After I assemble my men, not even the flow of time will stand in our way!
All will BOW before us!
SC: (This guy's nuts! I'll have to beat some sense into him!)
CC: HEY! Don't think you can get the jump on me!
I control time, and the outcome of this battle as well!

CC: You fight well, Crab of Space...
Just like me! Ha ha ha!
SC: So, you'll stop your crazy plan for galactic domination!?
CC: Oh, you sweet, stupid, idiotic, imbecelic crab...
The only thing that could stop me is time itself!
SC: (Huh? I thought you controlled time??)
CC: I'll be taking my outro, at the moment.
Maybe I'll get YOU to join me, someday... my Starlight Rival!

SC: Starlight Rival...(thinking)
... *(grins)
If it's a rival he wants, then that's what he'll get!
I'll find the best crabs in the galaxy, get them on my side, and take Chrono Crab DOWN!
Time to start the fight!

BPFDb; Time to start the fight!

SC: BAFU; Well, this is the place. Top Crab said I would his friend here.
BAFW; Is that him? He's the only crab around, so, probably.
CC: BAFMa; Oh? Who is this small, pathetic crab I see, minutely walking my way?
SC: BAFCd; Minutely? Huh?
CC: BOFDd; Go on, speak what you came here to speak.
BIFBe; My time is minutely precious to me, in a way that YOU wouldn't understand.
SC: BDFHa; (Again with the minutes...)
BAFA; Hi. I'm Space Crab- Top Crab sent me here.
BAFAg; He said that you might be willing to join my new exploration group- the Star Seekers.
BMFHa; Uhh...
BPFQa; Top of it's class, big plans ahead, and you'll be in on the ground floor. What do you say?
CC: BMFM; ...
BMFK; ...
Actually... my time is better spent elsewhere.
SC: BAFU; Oh, I see. Can't get everyone, I guess.

CC: BLFQa; Building my OWN Star Seekers!
SC: BHFP; WHAT?!
CC: BAFQa; No, not just seekers... a Galactic Empire!
BKFK; After I assemble my men, not even the flow of time will stand in our way!
BKFPb; All will BOW before us!
SC: BPFDe; (This guy's nuts! I'll have to beat some sense into him!)
CC: BAFBd; HEY! Don't think you can get the jump on me!
BPFQa; I control time, and the outcome of this battle as well!

CC: BAFQa; You fight well, Crab of Space...
BAFL; Just like me! Ha ha ha!
SC: BBFRb; So, you'll stop your crazy plan for galactic domination!?
CC: BAFAe; Oh, you sweet, stupid, idiotic, imbecelic crab...
BAFOi; The only thing that could stop me is time itself!
SC: BAFDd; Huh? I thought you controlled time??
CC: BLFJb; I'll be taking my outro, at the moment.
BPFQa; Maybe I'll get YOU to join me, someday... my Starlight Rival!

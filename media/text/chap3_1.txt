1F: The life of a fan isn't easy.
But man, it sure is fun!
Staying up to date with the latest Space Crab news...
Buying all of the merch, downloading the newest soundtracks...
I can't imagine doing anything else!
Though, I haven't seen any Space Crab updates in the last few days.
Did his ship explode again? That would be so typical.
Maybe this will be a #SpaceCrab3 situation!
music
??: You know... Fan of Crabs...
I do have news on the Crab of Space.
1F: No way! Please, do tell! Do tell!
CC: You do want that, don't you?
You must first prove your ability in battle!

CC: Oh my, how strong you are!
You really are worthy of knowing the happenstance!
1F: Really? That battle didn't SEEM that tough.
CC: You think I have a REASON to let another crab beat me? Nay-say.
Just like the Crab of Space had no reason to let me win.
So he didn't.
His pathetic "Star Seekers" don't have the compassion to let a poor, defenseless-
1F: WAIT.
Space Crab's been involved with the STAR SEEKERS??
They're the hottest group in the rumor mill!
I haven't heard of any confirmed members - but if one of them is SPACE CRAB...
I NEED to find out more!

CC: Not the outcome that time predicted...
...but the seeds have been planted. (evil smile)

MC: That's what started all of this?!?
Some petty argument between you and Chrono Crab?!
SC: Well, I mean-
MC: The crabs you've hurt, the crabs you've left CLUELESS-
And now, you're saying that MORE are on the way?!
SC: Yes, but-
MC: I AM GOING TO FIND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE CRABS-
AND TELL THEM TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU!

SC: (He's not listening - it looks like I'll need to get serious!)
Mad Crab! If you won't back down - I'll need to knock some sense into you!

MC: Won't back down?! WON'T BACK DOWN!?!
Don't try to turn this around on me!
Anyone can see who the villain is in this situation! 
SC: A VILLIAN!? You think I'm a VILLAIN?
Just because I discarded a few crabs by the wayside?
It's all about the size of the group! I'LL GET THE HIGH SCORE!
Put me on the leaderboard, take Chrono Crab off, I'VE EARNED MY SPOT!
MC: There it is- the selfish intentions of a deranged crab.
You've removed all hesitations I have about beating you into a pulp.
Let's do this.

MC: Don't promise those crabs a dream you can't provide.
If you do that, then you've STARTED to make up for all the stunts you've pulled.
RL: Ease up, hey? Don't you think this guy's taken enough of a beating?
MC: No where CLOSE to enough. But if he's going to take the time to think things through...
SC: ...
I'll give him the time.

HC: BUFOe; (The crabs you meet on vacation.)
CK: BVFAg; You see, you see, we have a marvelous selection of sweets!
BIFAd; Pastries, souffles, cookies, and more!
BUFDa; But no cakes, no no no!
BMFOc; ...I kid, I kid! If it's a dessert, we have it!
HC: BAFJa; Oh! Uh, anything for dinner? No sugar yet, please.
CK: BUFG; Hmmm, a request I'm not used to receiving.

BZFO; Presenting- Pineapple Pasta, perfect for our Hawaiian guest!
HC: BBFVa; ...
BAFS; Wow. That tastes really, really great.
BSFI; Though, maybe that's the starvation talking.
CK: BUFKh; So, have room for dessert?

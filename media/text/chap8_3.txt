HC: That worked up an appetite.
Good thing the resort has a 5 claw resturaunt on property!
Featuring the chef with a galaxy wide reputation-
Crab Cake!
I wonder why he's called that? Is that his signature dish?
CK: Ah, welcome, welcome! Can I show you to a seat?
HC: (The crabs you meet on vacation.) (smiling, amused)
CK: You see, you see, we have a marvelous selection of sweets!
Pastries, soufles, cookies, and more!
But no cakes, no no no!
...
I kid, I kid! If it's a dessert, we have it!
HC: Oh! Uh, anything for dinner? No sugar yet, please.
CK: Hmmm, a request I'm not used to recieving.
You will help me by rattling my noodle to create an on-the-spot brainstorm!
Your first course, then? A battle!

HC: As great as that was, it made me even hungrier.
Please... tell me you thought of something!
CK: Ah, ah ah, I actually got my idea before the fight started!
Using my 'noodle', I thought of the perfect dish-
and whipped it up during our fight!
Presenting- Pineapple Pasta, perfect for our Hawaiian guest!
HC: ...
Wow. That's really, really great.
Maybe that's the starvation talking.
CK: So, have room for dessert?

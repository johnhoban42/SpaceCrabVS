FC: ...
...?
I still... exist?

SB: My word. You are quite the anomaly, Future Crab.
FC: Space Bark! You can... talk?
SB: Well, it seems that in our many years apart from each other, you've picked up the doglish language.
What a treat it is to finally talk with you.
FC: I would love to have a simple chat, but...
My existence here is perplexing.
Is this reality, or the hallucination of a lonely old man?
SB: Hmm, well, how do I put it...
I 'may' have an answer. But is it worth destroying the timestream if I happen to be wrong?

SB: I suppose no harm can come from talking, can it?

SB: I wouldn't worry about that, Future Crab. The future has already been altered!
Think of you being here, with your current personality, sense of self, and memories...
As a sort of... bonus.
Plus, when you finish your business, I'm sure the other crabs will take you on in battle, anytime!
FC: So what, I simply exist here, along with my past self, and my old friends?
What's the catch?
SB: As long as there are players willing to play, the game will go on.
After that, who knows?
FC: Well, in that case, for the 'rest of the game', I'll make the most of my time.
Starting with our simple chat. I've always wondered, how do you walk using only four legs?
SB: It's tough, but I manage it, somehow. It all started when I was a young pup...
